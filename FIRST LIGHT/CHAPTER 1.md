Xaden Riorson is a hulking, scowling presence every time he enters a room; he doesn't need to speak for an individual to understand his analysis of them—he either looks like he mildly tolerates you, or wishes you'd evaporate into pink mist at his earliest convenience. His jaw and shoulders bear the tension that a single father of triplet daughters working overseas on an oil rig might carry, and he doesn't smile. In retrospect, Dain doesn't smile often either, but the blinking ideation of Xaden Riorson smiling made him tremendously uncomfortable, even though they had only known each other for thirty minutes. He spoke with objective enunciation and pointed disinterest, leaned up against the wall of Dain's closet-sized hospital room,

"Your benefactor," Dain notes the buried, clear consonants of a Spanish accent in his dry baritone, "has enrolled you into the IRT program through the Mairi's congregation."

He registers his surroundings: Xaden Riorson, a cop; the fluids and blood bags with thin plastic tubes like streamers on the handles of a bicycle filtering into his arms; the pale, mint green fabric of the curtain hiding the setting of wherever he was; and a *flip phone* thrown against his chest with a sticky note that reads:

**Call. -Cath**

"What is an IRT program?" He chokes, voice strained from lack of use. He'd been awake for a week now since waking from his induced coma, was finally off the feeding tube, walking feebly and orientated enough to retain his short-term memory and recall what his life *had* been before being stabbed in a cafe in SOHO.

"Involuntary Residential Treatment Program," Riorson straightens a bit, "currently a private commitment."

"...and that means?"

Dain's inquiring brows seem to irritate the infinitely tall man.

"That you were committed into the program by a legal-guardian; if you don't complete the program you'll be court-ordered, and forced to start from the beginning—assuming you even make any progress—until you complete the recommended requirements."

His biceps and forearms spread against his chest, squeezing together heavy pecs that make his badge, with *Captain* engraved into the gold metal, careen upwards in protest.

Dain looks down at the phone, then asks,

"Where am I?"

"Mairi Ranch on Riorson Reservation." Xaden *Riorson* replies, through clenched teeth.

"How long have I been..." Dain meekly waves over his body,

"Who cares." He snarls, clearly exasperated from having to speak to another human being. Dain narrows his eyes at the cop as he moves to peer down at him like a common criminal,

"Cocaine," he sneers, "of course—and *heroin,* amongst other things, trace amounts of fet, and a BAC sitting perfectly at zero-point thirty five. You survived all that unholy shit just to roach through getting stabbed too? And in your liver?"

He tosses the paper that had been folded and shoved into his front pocket—somehow—despite the fact that if he inhaled too deeply, his uniform buttons would fire off and punch through his skull like nine-millimeter rounds, onto Dain's chest with the flip phone,

"Cath Carnegie called in a favor to my father and you *will* complete this program."

Dain's brow twitches.

"Yes, officer." He clips bitterly as the man swaggers towards the door,

"Careful *mijo,*" he bites back, twice as spitefully, "Carnegie might be fond of you, but your Papa's gone and that means you amount to a grand total of fuck-all."

He opens the door and humbles himself enough to level a disgusted glance at Dain then strides through it.

"You get too comfortable and we might finish you before the program does."

Dain glowers.

"Fuck you." He mutters under his breath.

He's not afraid Riorson will hear the insult, but he is weary of what the officer isn't afraid to do *after* he hears it—so he says it to himself as he awkwardly works the paper that was tossed on him in his hands. It tells the tale of treatment so far, including the fifty-day inducement for his own health, the severe damage done to his liver and the consequences of his *habits* in his slow recovery. His eyes skim over the top of the paper where bold lettering reads; his name; and the reservation location.

In Presidio, Texas.

Where the *fuck* even was that.

He releases the paper and picks up the phone to call Cath with compounded frustration as his hands tremor. Of course his contact is the only one entered in the damn phone, Dain lets a defeated sigh slip past his lips as the phone rings and finally Cath answers as the automated voicemail plays, 

"Dain."

"Hello Cath,"

Cath grunts.

He'd never been one for words, *literally.* Though it was the main reason they got along so well as a weird, uncle-nephew kind of combination. Phone calls with Cath and an unknowing person might get frustrated but Dain was accustomed to his inclinations and the seconds *tick-tick-tick* by as he waits for more words from his god father,

"Finish the program. There is nothing for you to have unless there is progress to be reported."

"How am I in *Texas*?"

"Me." Cath grunts in a tepid shortness; he might've added *obviously.*

Dain licks his lips, "I don't have a wallet or—,"

"You don't need it." Cath jeers, "The same way you did not need *drugs.*"

Another man, the spitting image of the cop who'd just absconded to his precinct in the fiery pits of hell, steps into the room.

"Finish. The. Program." Cath concludes and hangs up. Dain places the phone down shakily, doesn't snap it shut or end his side of the call and the muted, blearing horn of it though it's shitty speakers ripple through the air.

"Hey," Riorson's slimmer doppelgänger chirps, "Just wanted to introduce myself. Bohdi Durran, a handler here on the reserve. I'll be taking you down to the chapel once the nurses discharge you."

"I'm being discharged?" Dain peeks down at his navel and *hunger* gnaws at him,

Bohdi tracks Dain's gaze.

"You've been asleep for about two weeks," then he adds, "It'll be in your writeup, don't worry."

"I'm not worried," Dain snaps.

Bohdi lifts a singular raven brow.

"Do you guys have... like a laptop that I can use?"

"Internet usage is restricted during this phase of your program." Bohdi recites.

"Are you fucking kidding me?" Dain grinds his teeth, winces at the sensation and inhales sharply, "Bohdi, I was in New York. I was in New York, New York—,"

Bohdi straps his hands to his hips, "I guess?"

Dain's voice breaks into a high octave as he begins to recognizes the cold sweat spreading between his shoulder's like wings and a telling agitation nipping at his patience. His attention wanes on Bohdi's figure; he could get in touch with Halden, or Camlaen to contact Halden for him. Cath was there in his phone too. He was there covering Dain's eyes while he watched his father's body swing like a pendulum from the living room chandelier after he dialed the older man's number into his iPhone. He hadn't said a word, just breathed into the receiver until the cold metal eventually slid from his hand and shattered across the marble floors.

His throat had already been dry but it was now unbearable.

*It was withdrawal.*

He'd been sleeping four fifty fucking days and this was the consequence of involuntarily quitting cold-turkey. 

From what? He thinks, grabs the paper with his lab results printed neatly in Courier at about twelve or thirteen in font size. It could be anything. He had a bottle of wine and a Xanax the night before to get to sleep, woke up, then had two lines to get through his morning lectures. He'd been swamped by reporters on the way to a friends, his palms itch at the thought, and—Cath didn't know Halden was his main supplier, right? He could just solemnly ask for a friend to visit him because who the fuck wants to be alone in some random place, randomly, with no one know with you?

"This is basically fucking kidnapping—,"

"You're tweaking out bud," Bohdi grimaces, and velvet-smooth Spanish slithers around Dain, "*¿Qué lo que, matatán?*"

"I just need to contact my friend, I know you have internet—,"

Bohdi chortles, grabbing his sides, "Man; in yours and *my* wildest dreams."

Who wants to be alone in a place with no fucking internet?

"Anyway, I'll be out front to take you to your casita." he opens the door behind him and begins to disappear through it.

"I'm not going to a fucking *casita,*" Dain barks, "I'm going to New York."

"You could try, *matatán*." Bohdi chuckles, "But the reservation is two hundred-fifty thousand acres of surveilled land in the Chihuahuan Desert, and backed up to the Chinati Mountains."

Dain blanches.

"Here's the nurses now, see you out front." he smiles.

---

Dain's *casita* is one of just a dozen, housed between sprawling fields of corn and other crops. It looks nearly dilapidated on the outside and is a somewhat harmonious combination of sun-bleached wood and stone obviously masoned from the random gargantuan rocks littered throughout the desert, and a large window framed in black metal. The palm sized house is perfectly square in shape and boasted a front porch the size of the hospital room he'd been in with two red, plastic chairs and small wooden table beneath them. There's a small shallow, inset pathway that leads them up it's stairs past manicured aloe vera plants the size of armchairs and Bohdi unlocks it's front door whilst Dain does his best to focus on the small light to the left of the door and not the way his teeth are chattering in ninety degree weather.

The deadbolt unlatches and Bohdi takes his trembling hand in his bronze one and presses the key into Dain's palm; it's got some sort of crest on it with a dangling charm that reads: *"Oops! Try Again!*". The air blasting from an cooling unit directly above the door casts them in an icy spell after they shuffle into the tiny space and the casita's interior steals Dain's attention.

It's a magnificent tiny house that's limited square footage had been industriously and efficiently utilized. He could walk maybe twenty feet and reach the back of the house past a kitchenette, breakfast bar for two and a full-sized sink. The walls are all painted white ship-lapping with walnut details, save for the sectioned space in the back—which was probably a bathroom.

"Washer-drier combo is in the utility closet at the back. Plan your laundry days carefully cause you gotta walk around *la casita* to get to it." He makes a circle with his hands as Dain collapses haphazardly into the built in couch at the left of the entrance, then points to Dain's calves,

"There's some shoes under there for you, clothes in the closets there, trimmers, razors, soaps and everything else you need in the bathroom sink. Your benefactor made sure it was filled with the things you needed. Beds through there."

Dain's head slumps forward then nods back; being rude to these people wouldn't benefit him at all. They were his only points of contact outside of Cath and as much as he wanted to tell Bohdi to kindly fuck off, for no reason at all, he bit his tongue and instead focused on the tear-sized sweat drops beading down the back of his neck from his hairline while his eyes fluttered and refocused on Bohdi's blurred body. They pinball in their sockets as he admires the Spanish that occupies every inch of flooring,

"There's lights and music that are automated in this *casita*, it's our newest one too. Anything you damage or need while here will be charged to your benefactor. For food and board you'll rotate between Mairi ranch, and then farms, as an aide if you want to keep a private space."

"What if I don't want to be an aide," Dain rasps, panting and licking his cracked lips,

"Then you'll be moved to the shared space in the chapel with all the other attendees." Bohdi declares, "And I don't know about you, but I like any bit of privacy I can get."

Dain lets a strangled cry force it's way through his body.

"What do I do as an aide?"

"Whatever the ranch and farm hands ask you to do." Bohdi pipes, dropping into the wicker armchair ahead of the couch,

"I don't know shit about farming." Dain mutters then sits up a bit as the stinging ebb of confusion fades for a moment, "Or ranching."

"You'll learn," Bohdi *reassures* him, as if playing in dirt was something he looked forward to doing. He cuts his eyes at the Spaniard, then scoffs loudly before sinking deeper into the couch and their knees bump in the menial space between them,

"Right." Dain whines.

Bohdi lets a sideways glance dissect Dain before he comments, "You know, for someone who's listed as severe, you've got quite the hold on yourself."

Dain throws up his hands, "I'm a *highly* functioning addict." he slurs,

It took about three years to get to this point, from twenty to twenty-three he consumed any prescription that would leave him feeling numb, snort any powder that made him smile, inject whatever concoction made him unable to think any more deeply than an inch within his mile-wide mind. Dain remembers he has a year left in his mathematics program, and even less in his second accounting and finance secondary major. He could do math to the hundred-thousandth place in his head while applying fractions and percentages and compounding interests with penalties and whatever other stupidly, pointless remedial shit the professors had them doing in class that day. Dain could drive drunk, hold conversations ten lines in, and still make it to class on time albeit sweaty as hell, probably.

"My efficacy is one-hundred percent while otherwise impaired."

Bohdi grimaces and his features , "That's fucking awful, *matatán*."

"It could be." Dain acquiesces,

"I think it already is."
 
He stands up runs his hands through his glossy black hair before dragging them across his face and exhaling, "Nurses will be by with some medications for you in the evening. They all have keys so don't worry about falling asleep or anything."

"What medication," Dain demands almost immediately, like a tell-tale addict.

He inwardly chokes himself when Bohdi's brows float into the ceiling and the man turns out of the front door then disappears with the dusty golf cart he'd driven them here in.

*"Son,"*

His body freezes further under the air conditioning unit as he molds into the couch, and his father places a lukewarm, paled hand on his knee,

*"It's just business like everything else. Play the part and practice punctuality, its a program."*

It's no different from college, he agrees; show up, crunch the numbers, *leave*. His eye flit over at him, at the older version of himself, his vision doubles and blends into itself; he'd always looked so much like his father it bothered his mother when she was here. She had often complained about it too, things about carbon copies and genetic cloning that not even his father could afford. His own eyes burn into him, challenging him,

*"Did you hear me, son?"*

"Yes." His voice echoes through the *casita* and part of him remembers he was talking to his father and not to himself.

*"Just sleep it off, they're bringing you more stuff."*

He does as he's told, like always, and sprawls across the tile where sleep caresses him and he falls into her gentle embrace eagerly.

---

Dain wakes up in crippling pain.

He gasps, shivering because the air conditioning has frozen him solid along with half of the symptoms he was being pelted with earlier. His hands butterfly down to the bottom of his ribcage where the bandaging blots with fresh blood, he blinks at the spots and the dotted edges before dropping his head back against the tile.

"Fuck."

It's dark outside now, and it's fucking *frigid* in the damn *casita.* His eyes flare as he searches for a thermostat along the wall of the unit and spies it just to the left of the door handle and above the wicker armchair.

Lifting himself up is a three-step-program: rolling to his side, then his knees, and then standing. He uses the couch as an assist and almost screams on the way to his feet. He glares at the thermostat, resignation already building at the forefront of his thoughts and takes the three debilitating steps required to reach the dimmed screen. He presses a shaky, sweaty finger against it and immediately yields at the outside temperature that reads sixty fucking degrees when just yesterday he'd melted on the ride here at about ninety five. The unit is set to hold at sixty eight degrees and he jabs his fingers at the LCD, punishing it until it shines seventy-two at him and holds the doorframe for support as he turns back towards the kitchen.

He spots the colorless, opaque medicine measuring cap before he can register what it even is and finds his feet dragging towards it in unmeasured desperation. He tosses the pills into his mouth and sucks on them until they dissolve bitterly against his tongue like a psychopath then winces while under the sink faucet to wash the lingering taste from his mouth. Underneath the cap was a pink slip, and Dain snatches it from the countertop.

*Benzodiazepines* and *Antipsychotics* he reads, to help with hallucinations and severe agitation; *Clonidine* and *Buprenorphine* for Opioid withdrawal, *Thiamine* and multivitamins to detox, and a sleeping aid.

The paper crumples as his fist tightens around it.

No oxycodone for the blistering pain in his liver, no Xanax to quiet his mind to the thoughtless void of sleep, and no Adderall to drown his brain into unfeeling mush. 

There's a mason jar labeled "apple sauce," and next to it another that reads "stew" against a brown liquid. He sidles the wall after taking the applesauce and stumbles into the bedroom where his body sinks deliciously into the soft mattress of a full-sized bed. He's appropriately exhausted because standing, walking ten feet, and climbing into a bed uses every bit of conjured energy his body has to give while fighting the irritation and tremors of his withdrawal. He pulls out the flip phone and begins texting Cath with fucking T-9 in the twenty first century.

**I want to come home.** 

Cath wastes no time replying and Dain smiles.

**You need this.**

Which, he's right. Dain's eyes hood, and his smile shrinks slowly.

**I can't do this.**

Two minutes pass before Cath messages again.

**You have a sixty day head start. You will.**

Dain unscrews the mason jar and drinks the applesauce down in fractional amounts, but it only takes three sips for him to feel full.

**Will you visit?**

**Of course.**

He snaps the phone shut and lays it on the pillow next to his with the mason jar. A free sixty day sobriety, he thinks *maybe* he could it, especially since there was no money to spend fueling his addictions anymore.

---

At seven in the morning his attending nurse, Gloria, knocks on the *casita* door and lets herself in, she greets him as she usually does and helps him sit up in the bed, slowly with gentle patience and affection,

*"Ey, papito lindo."* she whispers as she tenses under his grasp, letting him lift himself against her as a crutch, "How are you feeling today?"

"Like shit." he wheezes,

*"Ah, ok ya."* she hums, "You remember I told you this is not going to be easy?"

Dain slouches and his midriff pinches in deference causing a slinging pain up his spine, Gloria frowns and places a warm hand between his shoulder blades to encourage him to sit upright.

"Yes ma'am," he mutters, head slumped but his back straight,

"We try to shower today, sí? *La ducha,* no rags." she says, tapping his legs and pulling them hesitantly towards the edge of the bed, *"Ven acá."*—

*Come here*, she commands.

He watches her face as she assists him, waiting for irritation to blossom across her genuine features but she's all grand-motherly smiles and reassuring glances; her knobbed, slender fingers grip tenderly at his body as he navigates the pain standing up from the edge of the bed,

"*Ducha*," she repeats as they begin the trek through the casita together, "We change your bandages first; check the sutures."

He's already sweating as they pass through the small kitchen, but he takes in more detail he hadn't yesterday as Gloria curses under her breath about how no permission was given to relocate him and *they* should've told her about it. There's a full-sized fridge, tell and unusually narrow, and oven, with two lower cabinets worth of pantry space between them. The sink is a huge farmhouse style with a polished concrete finish and a fixed faucet, all the counter tops were white marble with a gentle glitter in the ambient lighting that bathed the *casita* in warmed hues.

The bathroom was a single wet room with a glass to stop the splash of the shower head from drenching the wink and toilet opposite of it. Gloria gestured for him to unbutton his shirt and rummaged about through a basket she'd placed on top of the lidded toilet,

"Take off," she rotated her hands at the metal clip that kept the bandages fastened over his wound, "We will clean it first then you will shower. I will help."

Dain nods. He wasn't going to chance arguing with her even though he wasn't fond of the idea that she was going to stand there and watch him shower; Gloria was headstrong and always finished her tasks to the best of her ability as a nurse. His hands work at the clasp, slipping against it as his tremors plotted against him, taking away his dexterity and melting his already nonexistent patience with it. Gloria sets up what she needs to assist him while he fumbles with the clasp for that duration, achieving nothing until she turns around to rake her greyish eyes over his abdomen and his fingers finally steady long enough to find purchase against the impossible surface area of it and he pinches the pieces apart.

"Fuck." he swears, shaking his head. His body thrums aggressively, and his eyes peel back as she takes the stretchy bandages from him and begins unwrapping them for him,

*“Sí, yo sé, papito.”* she coos, *Yes, I know, Papito.*

Once the bandages are off and snaked over themselves in the sink Gloria clicks her tongue at him, "Really, Dain?"

His eyes slide down and across the dried spots of blood by his sutures.

"You're lucky none of them ripped." she reprimands, patting at them with a sanitary rag. Her touch is the most careful he'd ever experienced; it was practiced and master classed, thorough but never once hurting him. She places a a transparent film over the wound, pads over to the shower and starts it, letting the steam warm the bathroom before commanding the removal of the rest of his clothing. Dain stands stark naked in front of his elderly nurse, nervously covering his crotch while she grabs a bar of soap and a rag from underneath the sink,

"Sorry." he mumbles, hushed against the patter of water on Spanish tiles,

"No need for shyness, I just don't want you to slip or get a weak on your own."

"This is always embarrassing." he admits as he takes the rag from her.

Gloria meets his eyes with determination in her own, "Embarrassment is only a taste of what you will come to feel the next year, *Papito.*"

He doesn't respond.

Gloria turns away as he works the soap into the rag, hands the bar back to her, and scrubs himself slowly. He drags it over his arms, his chest, near the dressing, then he glances at his nurse, bending slightly to get his thighs and childishly attempting at his knees and everything further,

"That's exactly how you would have ripped them if I wasn't here." she scolds when she notices his posture,

Gloria smacks his hands away and steals the rag from him, bending down slowly in her age to scrub his lower body in meticulous detail before handing it back to him, "Get your other parts, I'm going to grab you clothes."

He washes himself more carefully in her absence until she returns minutes later with a stack of folded clothing while he stands under the expensive looking shower head. The water beats softly against his skin and rolls down his body and warm streams that break off and fracture in different directions across his skin. He places his palms against the tile ahead of him and drops his head, letting it drum over his scalp.

He doesn't think, doesn't move, and holds his breath.

"Today we are going to talk about the program itinerary." Gloria tells him, while she waits in the corner with his towel, "And what your guardian has organized for you."

She hands him the towel after he cuts the water off and carefully lifts one foot intentionally at a time across the tile.

*"Ask about the inheritance."* His father says from behind her, materializing against the terracotta tile behind her, his mocking eyes drilling into him within a version of his own face,

*"¿Tú quieres comer algo?”* she asks as he rubs water off his skin, *You want to eat something?*

"No."

Gloria narrows her eyes at him, *“Tú sabes lo que te estoy diciendo, ¿eh?”,* she prods carefully, *You know what I’m saying, right?* 

*“Lo suficiente.”* he responds, *Enough.*

She helps him into a short sleeved shirt that hangs loosely at his sides and almost to his elbows, then lets him lean into her as he insists on pulling his pants and briefs himself,

"Why you didn't tell everyone you speak Spanish?" she questions him while she folds his towel over the rack and gathers her supplies into the small basket, then guides them back to the living area where she sits, barstool turned to face him on the couch while at the breakfast bar.

Dain places his hand along the backside of the couch as he turns to lower onto the cushions carefully. He minored in three languages and didn't count Spanish; it was his first and self-taught as a challenge. Understanding it came naturally—like math. *Everything* was just a language to him, and the ability to understand the ones outside of a person's native one were simply a matter of capability.

"It's the only thing I'm in control of right now." he admits somberly.

She gives him a look that only she could tell him the meaning of then lets it go, moving along their agenda.

"The IRT program is a year long, *Papito,*" she taps her leg, "It shouldn't start for you until your outpatient program finishes but your health was in particularly bad condition and Fen did not want to shelter you longer than necessary. So,"

He doesn't know who Fen is, but tucks the name somewhere that he hopes the withdrawal symptoms don't overwrite it.

Gloria sighs.

"You will enter an observatory period that will reduce the time needed for your regimen when the time comes that you are cleared for work by the doctor. Your criterion is *mi amorcita,* Sloane. She'll drop by today."

"What do I have to do to leave?"

"Sobriety for one year here, and upheld for a  year *after you leave.*"

Dain drops his head against the back cushion; of course there's a fucking probational period, "What happens if I break my sobriety?"

"Your clock resets, as well as your privileges,"

Dain's face screws up into displeasure, "And when I leave?"

*“Entonces vuelves.”*

*Then you come back.*

Gloria observes him again, quietly.

"It gets better." she places her hands over the other in her lap, "I promise, *Papito*, it gets better. But you have to want to help yourself from here on out otherwise..."

She looks out the sliding door ahead of the couch.

"Otherwise you won't leave here."

Dain chuckles, "They can't keep me here, that's illegal."

Gloria nods, slowly, and her thin, silky brunette hair rolls over her shoulder, "Your benefactor? *El cuarto de él es más grande que la ley.*"

His room is bigger than the law?

*"¿Cuarto?"* Dain parrots; does she mean quarter? His room?

"His money, *Papito*. His money is much bigger than the reserve. The Mairi's have been struggling and you are the reason they will keep their land, so long as you recover."

Dain laughs darkly, "How much did Cath offer him?"

"Enough."

Dain leans forward. He doesn't have a choice. Two hundred and fifty-thousand acres of internet-less desert, that he was being used as a guarantee for, between him and possible civilization? How could drugs even exist here to relapse with? His nailbeds itch as the two of them speak,

"I don't have a choice but to sober up in the middle of a fucking desert." he accuses.

Gloria’s eyes flick, just once—imperceptible, but calculating. She laces her hands together, her shoulders rise slowly and fall deeply before her steady voice fills the space between them again,

"Do not be so sure; the devil will find you even in church."

Dain holds her darkened gaze. *That* was a warning. Subtle, but dangerous as a livewire.

"Should I be worried about something, Gloria?"

She lifts her chin, "Only yourself and your recovery."

His eyes narrow; she gives away nothing. Nothing in her body language, or in either of the two she speaks, but her eyes snap to the door in surprising perception rather than surprise and she climbs off the barstool to open front door of the *casita.*

*"Mi amorcita!"* She sings, pulling a blonde into her loving embrace,

Gloria grabs his hand and steps away to reveal the newcomer, whose arm is laced against hers.

"*Papito,* this is Sloane Mairi, your criterion."

Sloane gives him an unimpressed once over,

*"¿Papito?"* she gapes as Gloria releases them,

"Sloane this is Dain Aetos, he's the one who's popular on the TV."

He doesn’t know what _he_ looks like anymore, but Sloane— she looks like looks like a fucking runway model in some kind of country filter. She's tall, maybe five-seven, still plenty shorter than him and probably infantile next to Riorson, with thick blonde hair braided in low messy, pigtails that bracketed her breasts against a lowcut t-shirt that hugged her torso so tight he could make out the lines of her tight navel and the dip of her bellybutton. Her jeans were huge on her and impressively low on her hips with a thick, studded leather belt—that did nothing for her besides keep the denim from sliding down her plump ass.

He'd seen women like Sloane on other women's vision boards, on the backs of horses or smiling in *Levi's* ads, and across *Sport's Illustrated.* She was casually *wild*, with giant, rounded baby-blue eyes, a straight, pointed nose, and a thick country accent that seemed wildly out of place around all this *Spanish.*

"You're not Spanish." he said stupidly, and Gloria breaks into a fit of laughter,

"None of the people you've met are Spanish, Dain."

"They speak Spanish." He deadpans.

"Dominican Spanish." Sloane amends, "Xaden and Bohdi, and Gloria are *Dominican*."

How the fuck is he supposed to know that? His eyes twitch while he forces himself to not slide them down her body again and Gloria recovers from her episode next to them, gasping for air as they stare at each other. Behind her, legs dangle from the top of the sliding door and his face contorts as he watches shiny black loafers swing in perfect beats like a human metronome against the wind.

"Texas is close to Mexico." The sentence slips out of him quickly, matching the pace that he rips his eyes away from the sliding door with,

Sloane looks over her shoulder but doesn't see them, "Also yes, Presidio is also *basically* Mexico—but this place? Owned by Dominicans, run by everything else that speaks Spanish. Mostly Mexicans."

"You're hallucinating." she announces to him, and Dain blinks; she said it like it was a normal thing,

"No." Dain croaks, then looks back again.

The legs are gone.

"The Quetiapine should help with that," she rummages around in her pocket and pulls a small Ziploc baggy of—*not* cocaine, and he nearly snatches it from her hand but stops because he can't move suddenly without pain sparking through him the way fireworks do during the Fourth of July—medicine that she extends to him,

"I was told to bring you those."

Gloria lifts her hands, "Oh you're about to be really sleepy *Papito*."

"Thank fuck." he groans and swallows them at once, dry,

Sloane shuffles to the kitchen in a rush and opens a cupboard by the sink.

"Take your medicine with water please." she suggests roughly, her irritated eyes go cold and seem so blue they're almost white, "You could choke."

Dain's head bobs with the snarky chuckle that slips through his nose, "It'd be an easier option than sobriety."

"We need you to live so we can get paid," her indifference stings, and she takes the glass from him and places it in the sink once he's drained the water.

"Have you eaten?" Sloane asks next,

"No." Gloria replies,

"Yes." Dain utters softly,

He and Gloria look at each other.

"No." He mutters this time.

*"No parece malo... pero quién sabe.”* Sloane tells Gloria gently; *He doesn’t seem bad… but who knows.*

There's pause in the *casita,* Gloria presses her diluted eyes against Sloane who shifts uncomfortably then glances at Dain; he's focused on her accent and not the silent exchange that passes between the two women. Her accent is...*odd*. He would say almost clownish, what with how her thick country drawl carved her Spanish into unfamiliar shapes and stretched syllables like soft taffy while hardening others abruptly.

*“Es un chamaquito muy bueno.”* Gloria calls him *a good boy* in response.

Sloane extends a hand towards him, "Can you walk?"

"Slowly," Dain admits,

"Let's go for a walk then, it's nice out."

Gloria grabs a cane he hadn't noticed earlier; it's wooden with all sorts of tropical birds carved into it and a beaked handle, she hands its to Dain.

"For when you get tired." She suggests, knowingly,

Dain takes the can and presents her a thankful smile, "Thank you, Gloria."

He and Sloane descend the *casita* pathway moments later with a Riorson-sized gap between them. It's still so early in the morning that the sun has only clawed halfway to it's position in the sky, there's a chill desert breeze combing through the hairs of their arms but a warmth lingers at it's edges, reminding him that the dry heat would be upon them once the sun reached it's destination.

"So you're *the* Cath Carnegie's son." she whistles, looking him up and down, blue eyes calm,

"Unofficially, I'm his close-friend's son."

Cath and his mother had been inseparable, which allegedly caused tension between himself and his father early in his mother's relationship with him. When she passed Cath had all but whisked Dain away, his father stopped the intervention from happening though, and purely out of spite.

"He was very strict about your inpatient program." Sloane reveals while kicking up gravel; she walks at a snails pace, watching Dain who lifts his feet with uncertainty and calculation.

He holds the cane tight in his hand, ready to slam it downwards to catch him if he stumbles. Gloria had staid in the *casita* to organize some more things Cath had sent for him and shooed them out, and he worried she might appear before him in a *Sazón* scented cloud if he misstepped. 

"He *is* a very strict person, by nature." Dain mentions,

"You should know," Sloane's voice turns dark, and serious, "He means for you to stay here if you choose to not take rehabilitation seriously,"

Sounds like Cath; kept where he can be seen and can't leave, the same way his father successfully isolated his mother. He wonders how long Cath would borrow the tactic of a man whom he despised,

"I know."

She seems surprised, turns her head towards him to look past him, "Since I'm your criterion, our remittance depends on my ability to get you to the finish line,"

It's a serious statement; there's a lot of alleged money weighing on her shoulders, which, he notices, are freckled and bronzed under the quarter-inch sleeves of her shirt. Sloane continues with a precise measure of words and her accent makes the information all seem casual, a perfected tone that was median of Bohdi and Riorson.

"Obviously you were in bad shape when you arrived. Considering the withdrawal and recovery post-inducement we're keeping you extremely medicated, just to help you out."

He can already feel the drowsiness seeping into him, "I really appreciate that. All of this sucks."

Sloane gives him an incredulously unimpressed glare, "Free rehabilitation for the rich kid who's only ever known warmth? You did this to yourself, *don't* expect pity here."

He hadn't expected her to delve into accountability. Her words cut and suffocated him in that smokey drawl; Sloane Mairi was not just another pretty face on prancing ponies. She continues as Dain recovers from her whipping honesty,

"Firstly, your liver needs to heal, while that happens you'll be participating in regular physical therapy with Gloria and the other nurses. In that time we're hoping you get past the most abrasive parts of your withdrawal—the hallucinations, outbursts, and general misbehavior."

"And after that?" Dain grumbles.

She's led them past the last *casita* in the bundle, a teal clay house with an older man smoking a cigarette out front. There's not much to see past them except desert, Chinati Mountains, and expanses of irrigated and symmetrical farming plots.

"Focus on one thing at a time." she remarks, her voice this time is more measured, less biting, "I don't want you fantasizing about what comes after. If you can’t handle today, you won’t survive tomorrow. So just start with today.”

Again, she leaves him speechless and soaking in the power of her flippantly found words. He hates that it makes sense. Hates it even more that it feels like something his mother would’ve said, if she’d made it out.

"I'm not here to bully you. We _should_ be on the same side—your success helps both of us. My job is to keep you grounded and make sure you don't waste this chance."

Dain stops, exhaustion is finally settling into his bones.

"But this isn't a chance."

"It's not." she admits,

"So I can't fail." he insists.

Sloane sighs and glances past him at the farmland. She's quiet for a moment and he shift his weight in discomfort, she notices then that he's sweating through the grey sweatpants that took him five minutes to pull on.

"That mentality is what will bring you faster to failure than any drug could to relapsing."

She works her arm into his and he limps back to the *casita* in foreboding silence.

---

It's dark outside, again, but this time it's late and it smells *amazing*.

He hears Gloria and Sloane comfortable in the *casita,* singing, and at the sound of steps, likely dancing too. The deep thrumming of a bass and the plucking, Spanish rhythms of an acoustic guitar paired with drums fill his mind in the luminous warmth of sun-heated salt water and white sanded beaches.

*"Nada comparo contigo..."* they chant, making him heady with the melody.

What a treat it would be to see Sloane flitting about, he thinks in his medicated daze, his legs move in response, angling towards the edge of the bed feebly. They're still singing as he slides off the edge of the bed and lands in the narrow space between the bed and the wall, Dain hits the floor hard, his legs buckling forward into the wall. Pain evolves into a loud groan between his teeth and he drops his body back against the bedframe and mattress in defeat.

The music, singing, dancing, all come to a stop as Gloria rushes into his bedroom,

*“¿Y por qué tú no pediste ayuda?”* Gloria begs, eyes wide with panic as the lights flash on in the bedroom; *why didn't you ask for help?*

"Turn the fucking lights off!" Dain snaps, growling into another burst of pain as Gloria begins positioning herself on the floor to help him,

Sloane's right behind her, and flicks them off almost immediately, "Gloria he's too big for you to get him up like that," she frets,

He winces as Gloria pulls his arm into her own.

"I got it Gloria," he agrees with Sloane; he couldn't stand to lose this woman in this godforsaken wasteland, he shakes her off and she looks so hurt he almost apologizes,

"At least let *mi amorcita* help you, yes?" Gloria wails,

He looks up at Sloane but the light from the kitchen obscures her face, she and Gloria switch places, and Sloane takes his left arm and slides it across her shoulders.

"You," she begins huskily, "Do not *ever* speak to me like no damned dog."

He begins to apologize as she bends her knees beneath herself to jack him upwards but Sloane isn't finished.

"I don't give a fuck how bad your symptoms are—you treat the staff here with the utmost respect. You hear me?"

To send her point home she jerks her body upwards and his legs scramble to keep up, almost dragging her down as he falters like a newborn deer; it takes minutes to straighten his knees out to standing fully and when he is Sloane shoves his arm from her shoulders and walks back into the kitchen. He slams into the wall and Gloria releases a chain of soulful Spanish curses then gets him to the couch where he pants like a dog at the pinging pain in his abdomen and torso.

"Lift up your shirt." Sloane barks as she and Gloria shift positions again,

*"Mi amorcita,"* Gloria scolds loudly, "Be respectful."

Sloane's eyes bulge while Dain lifts his shirt, trembling so badly he drops it once, 

"Like he just was?" she volleys.

"He is recovering!" she shouts, shaking a wobbling hand at Sloane, "He can't help it!"

Her blue eyes snap to Dain's and she appraises his wound, once satisfied she flees back to Gloria and leaves himself and his father in an awkward air of childlike awareness; the lingering warmth of music was completely gone and only breath and buzz remained. 

*"You shouldn't treat women like that."* he denounces Dain with his own face again,

"Don't *you* fucking tell me how to treat women." he bites, voice booming through the *casita.*

He isn't there, Dain thinks. He's *not* there at all but the smell of his sharp cologne and the shine of pomade in his hair is unmistakably real. His eyes narrow on Dain and he opens his mouth,

"Go away," Dain snaps, "Go away, you aren't *here*."

"Gloria he's hyperventilating," he hears Sloane fret in the kitchen, shuffling with plates in the sink,

*"Sí,"* she says, "His devil resides in his illness, *mi amorcita*, that is why it is so important that we cleanse the body of man-made impurities."

*"Women love man-made impurities."* his father coos.

Dain watches his father helplessly from the couch, slumped in a way that allows relief from the radiating pain beneath his ribs; the comment *consumes* him. He smells that fucking cologne all over the living room, in the same place he hung himself weeks ago, and the same place they watched his mother overdose in years ago. He could see her shaking body, perpetually slouched against the couch cushions at an unnatural position he'd never seen before, eyes fixed on him, following him as he paced frantically, screaming for a god who didn't exist. 

Who *never* did.

"Please," he pleads, voice hushed and breaking, "Please, you took mom already—*please,* don't take them."

The mind fog that began when he plummeted to the bedroom floor fills up his peripherals and panic sets in fully when he can't see Gloria and Sloane, he realizes he's alone here, with his father on the fucking couch.

"Please they're trying to help me, please."

His father grins, "I am too, son."

Sloane suddenly sits in the wicker armchair where he'd been and his body fades against hers as she starts to pray, hands laced and pressed against her lips.

"He won't come," Dain hisses, "He doesn't want me."

Her blue eyes pierce through him once, then close.

She keeps praying, it's a soft, cadenced blend of her heavily accented Spanish—goofy, but painfully honest.

"He never came, Sloane. He won't come now." Dain snaps, loud, but not yelling; he regains enough control to stop that from happening.

The *casita* is silent, and the air conditioning unit has frozen him solid from the perspiration of his anxiety again. Sloane's soft praying and the humming of electricity are the only sound in the night now and he escapes into the ambience until she eventually stops and stares at him. There's an odd familiarity that peaks gently between them before Sloane finally speaks as Gloria begins singing calmly in Spanish again as she wipes the kitchen countertops.

"He never came for us either, Dain." she whispers.
