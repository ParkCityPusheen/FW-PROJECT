*“Los muertos jalan a los vivos.”* 

Gloria tells him one night while sweeping, she hums as *Hozier* rumbles through the *casita's* built in speakers and Dain translates the superstition loosely into English,

*If you dream of the dead they will guide you to grave.*

She nods in dramatized agreement after seeing his head dip in laughable disbelief, gripping the straw broom tight in her fists she begins to sweep more roughly.

"You must heed the warnings your mind gives you."

He sinks further into the couch, "These are *your* warnings."

The sound of straw scraping across the casita floor falls silent and he glances over to see her aging eyes piercing through him. She points a sinewy finger at him, tremors working through in age, while shaking her head now, frustrated.

"They are signs from God, *Papito.*"

He can't help but snort, and she begins sweeping again.

He had been discharged from the hospital nearly a week and a half ago, on a sweltering Wednesday; now it was Sunday and still sweltering. They days were grueling and painful, but he appreciated the repetitive nature that was promised with the rising sun.

Dain didn't need to do anything besides what was expected of him, and so far it was only physical therapy, three times a day—at his request, following each meal—and *actual* therapy. He'd only been to two sessions, and they were experimental. Gloria insisted he see at least three to find a proper fit for himself.

Sloane stops by at least once a day and he's careful how he speaks when she arrives. They're both weak to Gloria, soft edges and heavy sarcasm surfacing despite their best attempts at self control in response to her rougher corners and motherly tendencies with them. Dain sinks into chivalry like it’s armor, hoping it might cover the inevitable slip-ups that coexist with his withdrawal and detox, most days it does but there are times that Sloane looks like she wants to drag him into the *casita* pathway and beat him senseless. He can't help it, but Sloane's adamancy that he properly take accountability for his actions—because choosing to abuse substances got him here, that was ultimately *his decision*—makes the urges and outbursts curve.

He *hates* when she becomes irritated with him.

He despises seeing that dulling in her porcelain gaze that was only ever brought on by his distasteful acts in moments of complacency and exhaustion, and Gloria—*bless her heart,* Sloane would say—would reprimand her for cussing him out. It was a chain reaction that he learned to recognize, he could feel it festering in choice reactions and avoided it like the damn covid because he hated the disappointment that would morph across Sloane's sun-kissed face at Gloria's scolding, even more than the agitated eyes.

She arrives at his *casita* at the same time that she crosses his mind, jaywalking from his thoughts into his immediate perception.

*What a treat,* he finds himself thinking as she smiles brightly at Gloria, stepping up and trapping the older woman in a tight hug, then letting her azure irises flick down to Dain while her chin rested on Gloria's shoulder,

“Therapy wearing you out?” she teases.

He snorts. “For what it’s worth.”

Sloane nods toward his leg, jittering against the tile like a piston with nowhere to go, “That’s new.”

He glances down, frowning.

“Got a fix for that?” he asks.

She shrugs, releasing Gloria and sinking into the wicker chair. “Just more physical therapy.”

Her scent as she passes him is intoxicating; like honeysuckle and lavender, clean like fresh laundry. She smells like this all the time, and at this point he could find her in a room of scents; the admittance that her scent grounds him the way Gloria's soft, chiming Spanish does when she reads to him makes him feel almost guilty.

It's like a habit: seeking Gloria's voice and Sloane's scent—he wondered if these would end up being addictions he'd need to be ultimately detoxed of as well.

He sighs, "I love that for me."

Sloane ignores him, "You can walk for nearly two hours without stopping now,"

Gloria lifts the broom handle over her heart with her hands gripped tight against it, 

*"Él se va conmigo por todo el pueblo, tranquilito, mientras yo le leo mi Biblia… dime tú, ¿no es un hombre de Dios, mi amorcito?"*

*He goes with me all over town, quietly, while I read him my Bible... tell me, isn't he a man of God, my love?*

Sloane raises a dark blonde eyebrow, "Are you?"

"I have no idea what she said." he tells Sloane dismissively, lifting his fingers off his thighs,

Gloria's eyes seer against his skin, *"Tú vas a saber lo que se siente esta escoba en ese culo tuyo, Papito."*

*You're going to know what this broom feels like in that ass of yours, Papito;* Gloria curses him this time, clicking her tongue and sweeping over his feet roughly on purpose. Sloane lets herself laugh and Dain flicks his gaze over miles of tamed, golden hair vibrating against her sides.

"I think it's time to get you around more, maybe the pastures?"

Dain guffaws and he lifts his head off the back of the couch cushion, "Are you asking me? Because I heard *pastor* and not *pasture* if you are."

"Oh," Sloane smiles at him, but it's not friendly—it's kind of evil and mischievous, and Dain feels a prickle against his skin—and then adds, "You're definitely ready for the pasture."

"Pastor?"

She narrows her eyes on him, "Pasture."

"Right," Dain extends his neck towards her; she's dropped her boots onto the floor and sites with her knees under her chin facing the kitchen, "Because there's a pasture in all this fucking desert."

Sloane *grins* and that prickle turns into despair.

---

Bohdi drops him off at the fucking *pasture* at eight-thirty in the morning after he'd finished his first round of physical therapy with Gloria, who was all damn smiles and *Papacito's.*

The sun's risen full to it's position in the sky and leers at him with warming disregard as he surveys the green mirage against the scorched earth and lifeless dirt he'd been gazing at for the last week. Dain stands there, dumbfounded, with his cane, running it across blades of plush grass in incredulity. His geographical understanding of the Reservation's location was either completely incorrect, or he was experiencing a hallucination.

*"Why not both?"*

Dain forces himself to look up and his eyes connect immediately with his father's, warm-brown eyes like his own, but soulless. He's there in a deep navy-blue, immaculately tailored suit, with a single arm extended outwards offering a white capsule, and a syringe with the same clear substance that sent his mother into mouth-foaming fit. They'd all taken it, but stupidly the men survived her.

He wonders, *was it planned, or a mistake?*

Dain watches his father's lip curl into something not quite friendly, but nonetheless inviting, *"...why not both?"* he proposes, with practiced neutrality.

*Why at all?* Dain thinks.

His father's face contorts, pain spreads through every receptor in his body and the sun gleans the sweat directly from his skin. It's already hot, maybe close to ninety degrees again and he melts there in the middle of the pasture. Panting he sets the cane down,

*"You kept me out for a few weeks son. We need to get back to work."*

He jerks his hand towards Dain and that haunting curve of his lip brings tremors over his flesh when his eyes flit down to the offering.

"*Keep things as they are.*" he warns, *"Remember: practiced, is perfection."*

The air in his lungs soak into the heated skies above him, Dain grabs his chest, heaving for a breath that couldn't come soon enough.

Fuck, he needed something, *anything*—besides this awful, propositioned communion.

He stammers forward, dropping the cane and pulling his feet forward, step after step until he passes his father; he's not breathing but he can still smell his cologne. It's so sharp it slices through Dain's senses like lockwire that cuts him into mosaic pieces while he stumbles past his father—and then it’s gone. Just sun. Just sky. Just grass. And—

And *Sloane.*

Sloane riding on the back of an unbelievably large, chestnut colored horse whose fur was so saturated it seemed like a tracer round splitting across the pasture. They're approaching *swiftly,* and Sloane is at complete peace; her face is fixed to the sun, a human sunflower with her golden petals braided into twin plaits that whip behind her uncontrollably. He watches her, in a daze, dropping into the grass when she's probably upon him.

"Another episode?"

Her voice soothes him, though not nearly as much a Gloria's luxurious spillage, but *enough.* His face deforms into disgust when he realizes he's able to breathe again and inhales through his nose—this horse smells like *shit.*

"Yes." Dain keeps his torso straight to not upset his wound, "Just recovering."

She gets up and retrieves his cane, "Want help?"

"Please," he croaks pathetically.

Sloane helps guide his arm over her shoulder and slowly lifts with him at his prompt; he can smell her again, that grassy honeysuckle sweetness that makes his sinuses clear and his eyes roll. He leans over her, subtle as he can and sniffs, injecting her essence into his senses. Once he's on his feet with the cane back in his hand, they look at each other,

"Ready?"

He lifts a single brow before dragging his forearm across his face, "I'm not getting on that horse Sloane."

"Not today," she agrees with a girlish coo,

"No," he swears, "Not ever."

"Trust me, you'll want to." she presses, like she knows something he doesn't because she probably does.

Dain rips his head back and glares at her in repulsion, "I am not scared. Ferrari's and Porsche reach over over two-twenty on a straightaway in *F1,*" he points at the horse, "*This* is not my kind of ride."

Sloane saddles up and peers down at him from the creatures back.

"F—*who* now?" she groans,

*"Formula One?"*

“Oh—Hot Wheels. Like fancy *NASCAR*.”

Dain settles a look of absolute offence onto her and she shrugs, pulls the cowboy hat from where it lies hooked to the saddle, and presses it to her crown.

"One hand on the horse *fancy man,*" Sloane commands, tipping it, "Time for some *Reservation Rundowns!*"

She drops her feet against the horse's sides and it starts off in a slow saunter. Dain sighs, eyeing the horse like it’s a court summons but he does what he's told and set his palm against the strapping body of her horse.

"This is the pasture, obviously. It's only a twenty acre pasture, and it's meant for the horses only. Up yonder—," Sloane points directly ahead of them, and fucking actually says *yonder,* "There's a stable maintained and run by yours truly."

He almost smiles when she waves her hand against herself pridefully.

"We have about.... forty-two horses, currently, and the number typically fluctuates between twenty minimum to about sixty."

Dain watches his feet while he walks, and she trots.

"Sounds expensive,” he grunts, adjusting his weight like even saying it was work.

Equestrian lifestyles were always expensive, without a doubt. Veterinarian's bills were more like studio rent and the equipment was equally so. He'd been with a rider before and it was all she talked about, horses and money, and he used to listen—until they fucked a few times and she insisted on never riding him because it was *all she ever did.* He wants to roll his eyes at the thought but his shirt sticking to every square inch of his skin starts to obscuring any other thought.

"You *would* know, and it is, but mostly for the buyers and boarders."

He follows the conversation but his mind jumps ahead suddenly, and he glances up at her, "You're not about to have me cleaning fucking stables are you?"

"*And* tilling fields. It'll be a rotational thing."

"Oh for *fuck's sake.*" he cries, "We have to listen to country the fucking time too I bet."

Sloane cocks her head to the side and her bangs wash across the side of her face, "You either care or clean."

"What does *care* get me?"

"Brushing, blankets, washing, braidin' maines."

He can't help smiling this time; when her drawl slips into their conversation and announces itself so loudly she frowns a bit and clears her throat. Their eyes meet but she's to dignified to look away so he watches her blush appear across her face in streaks. It's cute. Her waiting for him to ridicule that lazy *twang* of her verbiage; it's cute.

"I don't only listen to country." Sloane squeaks, she pulls one of her braids over her shoulder, "I'm from Georgia."

Dain shakes his head.

"You're from *Georgia?*"

"Swainsboro, Georgia. My mama was the Texan, but my daddy was from Georgia. Went to school out there; all-girls Catholic school. Then I came out here."

He stops walking to remove his shirt and files the *was* in her sentence away; like him her parents were just memories. "Where even is that?"

"Closer to Savannah than Atlanta." 

Dain stands there, head tilted, "I went to an all-boys Catholic boarding school."

"Mines was an academy; went to the same classes with the same people for 'bout twelve years."

"Didn't finish?" He asks gently, knowing it should take a whole fourteen years to graduate, "Respectfully."

Sloane body shift left to right, swinging with her horse's trot, "Finished early."

He grins at her, "Impressive. So you're in college?"

Her body tenses up and reaches for the reins, likely to take off but she glances down at him and sees his hand plastered to the horse's neck and stills, "No."

"I didn't mean to prod, I'm sorry."

Sloane nods. Something in her face still seems uneasy and he attempts to bury whatever it is for her,

"I'm not good at socializing while... not high." he admits wearily, focusing on the chestnut fur of the horse. He runs his hand along the smooth curve of it's neck and it's eye flick to him for a single heartbeat before refocusing on the journey.

"Her name is Thoirt," Sloane tells him, petting over the same trail he had made along the mare's neck, "She's the sweetest horse to ever grace these fields. Thoirt don't bite, kick, or cry."

Dain gives Thoirt a once over; he's six-three and his head just barely cleared her shoulders.

"Mama gave her to me right before she passed, so she'll be five in two months."

A huff of air escapes his nostrils and he pats Thoirt again, "I'm glad you have her," his voice breaks as Sloane brings them to a stop and Thoirt slowly turns her head towards him, nudging him with her snout.

"My mom didn't leave me anything. I don't think she had the chance."

Terror shocks through the wild skies in Sloane's eyes and she leans against Thoirt in the saddle, "Your mama passed too?"

"Three years ago—overdosed." his confession is rushed and it hovers in the heat around them; thick and uncomfortable.

"She would've wanted this for you."

He remembers her coppery hair and velvety-smooth skin, her manicured nails and toes, and the cute gap between her teeth that she'd whistle bird-calls through whenever she couldn't find him. The burden of her passive nature is too much for him and he tries to blink away the memories without recalling which they even are; tries to blur out what he participated in ruining,

"You're shaking."

"I'm fine."

Sloane had gotten off Thoirt and was holding his wrist, "You're not."

"I can't do anything about it." he snaps,

"You could tell Thoirt." Sloane encourages, pulling the reins towards them. Thoirt rotates where she stands, one heavy steps at a time, until he can see the pure white diamond between her eyes.

"Tell her what? *Neigh*?"

Sloane looks like she wants to slap him but she rolls her glittering eyes at him instead,

"Keeping all of that in doesn't help, and you won't participate in group sessions or say more then three words to the therapists you've met so far. So talk to Thoirt. I'll consider it your session for this week."

He cuts his eyes at her and sees his mother again in her height.

"You just said I've seen two—I've had *two* sessions this week."

Sloane shakes her head and takes a step back, "That you didn't speak during. How is it therapy if you don't speak?"

"I'm not talking to the fucking horse." He hisses through grit teeth, "This isn't *My Little Pony.*"

She mounts Thoirt again and snorts in frustration, "You're right, it's not."

Thoirt starts up at that manageable pace again.

"It's stubborn and *sad.*" she flings the words at him like knives and looks away, "Bohdi will bring you to the stables every morning after physical therapy; you'll help out until lunch and then do your next PT session and speak with a certified therapist between then and dinner."

She doesn't say anything afterwards, only watches him leaned against Thoirt as they venture further into the pasture and eventually upon a white stable with several fenced, dirt arenas. Sloane guides him to the stabled with Thoirt and points to a bench with a large metal fan and hands him a water bottle.

"Bohdi's coming to pick you up now." She announces.

"Sorry." is all he manages, blinking roughly in the generated gusts of wind,

"To who—me?" Sloane laughs incredulously, "Don't be sorry for me, save it for yourself."

---

Dain tells Gloria about his fumbling of his interaction with Sloane to keep her in the *casita* with him; he can't sleep and it's late, there's also the threatening rumble of thunder that escapes through the mountains ahead of the village.

It had been pouring the day he watched his mother pass.

He *hates* storms.

"Are you worried that you upset her?" Gloria asks with her quivering hand on his thigh.

"I don't care if I upset her." he stops, "I mean, I do. I just... don't want to be on the bad side of the person who's going to get me out of here."

Gloria sits up and drops her hands into her lap, "There is no *escaping* here, *Papito,* this isn't a prison, it's a program."

He exhales sharply, watching his leg bounce, "She's my criterion."

"And *you're* the criteria." Gloria volleys.
