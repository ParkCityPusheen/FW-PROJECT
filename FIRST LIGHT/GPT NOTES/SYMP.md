IM WRITING A NEW STORY:

After his father’s empire crumbles in scandal, Dain Aetos becomes the face of a legacy built on betrayal. Hunted by public outrage and lawsuits he can’t escape, Dain spirals into addiction—until his godfather, Cath, issues an ultimatum: get clean or lose everything.

Stripped of wealth, freedom, and trust, Dain is left to confront not just the wreckage of his family’s name, but the darkness he’s let consume him.

Redemption won’t come easy—if it comes at all.

SO:  
Dain is an addict with mildly severe addiction to alcohol and drugs, not limited to illegal and prescription ones. He is stabbed in the liver and stabilized in ny ny, his god father/benefactor Cath has his committed to the IRT.

What descriptively would his symptoms be as an addict waking up from an induced coma and how long would he had need to be induced? He also had BAC of .35 when he was stabbed and had abused heroine and cocain the day he got stabbed

THE SETTING:  
IN PRESIDIO COUNTY TX  
Mairi Reservation (Owned by Riorson Resrvations) is:

- ﻿﻿Three hours southeast of Marfa, with only a single dirt road leading in.
    
- ﻿﻿250,000 acres of federal trust land, largely self-policed, with its own clinics, schooling system, and correctional/ rehab programs (like your IRT).
    
- ﻿﻿Backed up against the Rio Grande, or nestled along the Chinati Mountains, to create geographical boundaries and a sense of "you can't run."

**Contextual Setup**  
Given:

- **BAC of .35** (potentially lethal)
    
- **Acute polysubstance use** (heroin + cocaine = speedball)
    
- **Penetrating liver trauma**
    
- **Induced coma** post-surgery for stabilization and detox
    

**Duration of Induced Coma**  
He'd likely be in a medically induced coma for **5–10 days**:

- **First 48-72 hours**: Immediate trauma care, surgery, organ stabilization.
    
- **Remaining days**: Controlled detox to prevent fatal withdrawal (especially from alcohol and benzos if present).
    

---

**Symptoms Upon Waking:**

**1. Physiological**

- **Tremors/shakes** (delirium tremens if alcohol withdrawal is severe)
    
- **Severe abdominal pain** (post-surgery and liver trauma)
    
- **Cold sweats, gooseflesh** (opioid withdrawal)
    
- **Racing heart, high BP** (cocaine aftermath and withdrawal)
    
- **Vomiting or dry heaving** (common after detox)
    
- **Muscle aches**, especially legs
    
- **Insomnia, exhaustion** paradoxically coexisting
    

**2. Psychological / Neurological**

- **Confusion** and disorientation (from coma + withdrawal)
    
- **Agitation or combativeness** (common in ICU detox cases)
    
- **Hallucinations**, both visual and auditory
    
- **Intense anxiety/panic**, bordering on psychosis
    
- **Severe cravings**—desperate, almost animalistic
    
- **Emotional volatility**: sobbing, rage, numbness in rapid cycles
    

**3. Long-Term Consequences**

- **Cognitive fog**: Memory gaps, slurred speech, poor reasoning
    
- **Possible seizures** if detox wasn’t tapered or he’d been abusing benzos
    
- **Jaundice** or yellowed skin/eyes from liver damage
    
- **Track marks/scarring** at injection sites

Let me know if you want a descriptive paragraph of what waking up looks/sounds/feels like from Dain's POV—like a fever dream shot through with pain and reality distortion.

#### 3. **The Misunderstanding of “cuarto”**

This is a brilliant touch — Dain’s Spanish is fluent but **literal**, and that disconnect becomes a metaphor for the entire situation:  
He **hears** the words, but he doesn’t **grasp** the subtext. Just like how he _thinks_ he knows the rules, but he doesn’t understand the game.

> _“El cuarto de él es más grande que la ley.”_  
> _“His room is bigger than the law?”_  
> “His money, _Papito._”

That’s some **Godfather-level subtext**

### 8. **Devil’s Presence in Illness**

Older Catholics believed that **addiction**, **insomnia**, and even **melancholy** were doorways for the Devil — symptoms of a soul in conflict.

> Gloria might believe (or pretend not to) that **the Devil lives in Dain's unwell body**, and speak to it accordingly:  
> _“You’re not him right now, so I’ll wait for the part of you that’s still worth saving.”_
> “The Devil doesn’t knock here, he sits in the pew and listens.”
> “That’s not a hallucination, _Papito_. That’s someone who heard your prayer.”
