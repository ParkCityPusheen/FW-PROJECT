*The Rusted Tap* was the type of bar that had floors that stuck to your shoes and the music was always just loud enough to require leaning in, which would have been fine if Sloane had anyone to lean toward. Kai had Baylor's thigh pressed against his under their table, fingers tracing idle patterns on denim while Avalynn sprawled across Baylor's other side, chin hooked over her shoulder, whispering something that made both of them laugh in that low, conspiratorial way that meant Sloane had lost her audience about ten minutes ago.

She's used to this though; being a third wheel to their little shared moments of affection didn't bother her in the least, before they were this weird coagulation of returned affections they were her closest friends.

"Honestly, you worry way too much to be that pretty without makeup Sloane." Avalynn yawns, leaning farther into Baylor, blinking at her from across the table with those doe eyes that made her 'big-bangeroos' on *only fangs.*

"Are you listening to me?" Sloane guffaws, "Do you even see me right now? I wear makeup. Everyday—bitch I used your mascara this morning."

Kai, bless the sweet summer child he was, nods at Sloane, "I'm listening Sloanie."

"Anyway, the thing is," Sloane begins again, "I sent my propsal two weeks ago. Two weeks. With citations. With a whole color-coded breakdown of who should handle what section, and you know what Marcus says to me today?" She doesn't wait for anyone to ask. 

"He says, *'Oh, I didn't see that.'* Didn't see it. It's in the discussions. It's pinned. I *pinned* it myself. After he asked me to do it."

She throws her hands out and over their table, the force of it bumps her into the back of her booth and Avalynn, Baylor, and Kai all exchange the same shit-eating smirk.

"You need to be pinned." Avalynn declares, loudly when the music abruptly switches over form indie-pop to rap; rap so fast she can barely make out the words.

Sloane ignores her.

"And Mel, fucking Mel. She's supposed to be handling the load calculations and she sends me this half-page mess at eleven PM last night, no math, no methodology, and has the nerve to say 'let me know if you want me to add anything.' Add anything? Add half of a fuck and and some effort maybe?" Sloane presses her palms against her eyes, "I'm going to fail because of other people. That's how this ends. Four years of maintaining a 3.8 and I'm going to get a C in Structural Analysis because Marcus can't check his messages and Mel thinks Wikipedia is a legitamate source."

"You're not going to fail," Kai offers, though his attention is clearly divided, thumb brushing across Baylor's knuckles.

"You don't know that." Sloane accuses, eyes wide, mouth scented by the sour ale lingering against her tongue.

"I know you won't let yourself fail," he amends, "You'll just do their parts for them like you always do and then complain about it for the next three weeks."

Sloane wants to argue, but he's not wrong. That was exactly what she was going to do because passing meant more to her than failing to prove a point ever could.

"You're right." she mutters.

Kai shrugs, because somehow he heard that?

"You should knock the cobwebs off your pussy!" Avalynn shouts.

Sloane and Kai both wince when Baylor and Avalynn explode into a fit of obnoxious laughter; the couples in the booth over shoot them dirty, disturbed glances as if the volume of the music weren't shaking the whole fucking facility enough to drown out some hollering hoooligans,

"Sex won't solve these problems you whore." Sloane groans.

"It won't, but it's the perfect distraction!" the redhead insists, "Check your phone!"

Sloane's eyes begin to roll while reaching into her pocket, "Avalynn for what?"

"For some spontaneous fun!"

The blonde unlocks her phone, blinking at the link sent to her:

*'Quick-Fix: meet singles in your area **tonight**'*

Sloane eyes flare.

"Have you lost your fucking mind Avalynn? Don't you remember the craigs' list singles killer?"

She only yawns after lacing Sloane with a bored glare, "You won't even make a *tinder* account, or bumble, and you onnly use your insta to be hot and aeesthetic. Therefore, *you* Sloane Mairi, have very limited options."

"I have two-hundred thousand followers. I can't go galivanting in people's inboxes, I have an image to maintain to keep the PR coming." Sloane argues; she weighs it in her mind though, still.

Garunteed mediocre sex, or free stuff?

*Always* free stuff, unless you were a man or some freak who hated free stuff.

Avalynn leans forward, "Make an account and respond to just one ad, and I'll let it go."

There's a moment where there's just the bass of an ending song booming between the fours of them befre adding:

"Or... I'll just invite some guys for you next we hang out."

Sloane wretches dramatically.

"I'd rather borrow Baylor or Kai." she hisses.

Kai turns to the side bashfully, "Awe shucks, Sloane." he teases cutely,

"Ew—did you really just say shucks? What do you want me to even say back to that? Jinkies?"

Kai giggles, covering Baylor's mouth for them all; only stupidity could ensure and she was busying herself registering for this creepily formatted site.
