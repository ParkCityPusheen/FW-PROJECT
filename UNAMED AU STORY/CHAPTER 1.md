*The Rusted Tap* was the type of bar that had floors that stuck to your shoes and the music was always just loud enough to require leaning in, which would have been fine if Sloane had anyone to lean toward. Kai had Baylor's thigh pressed against his under their table, fingers tracing idle patterns on denim while Avalynn sprawled across Baylor's other side, chin hooked over her shoulder, whispering something that made both of them laugh in that low, conspiratorial way that meant Sloane had lost her audience about ten minutes ago.

She's used to this though; being a third wheel to their little shared moments of affection didn't bother her in the least, before they were this weird coagulation of returned affections they were her closest friends.

"Honestly, you worry way too much to be that pretty without makeup Sloane." Avalynn yawns, leaning farther into Baylor, blinking at her from across the table with those doe eyes that made her 'big-bangeroos' on *only fangs.*

"Are you listening to me?" Sloane guffaws, "Do you even see me right now? I wear makeup. Everyday—bitch I used your mascara this morning."

Kai, bless the sweet summer child he was, nods at Sloane, "I'm listening Sloanie."

"Anyway, the thing is," Sloane begins again, "I sent my proposal two weeks ago. Two weeks. With citations. With a whole color-coded breakdown of who should handle what section, and you know what Marcus says to me today?" She doesn't wait for anyone to ask. 

"He says, *'Oh, I didn't see that.'* Didn't see it. It's in the discussions. It's pinned. I *pinned* it myself. After he asked me to do it at that."

She throws her hands out and over their table, the force of it bumps her into the back of her booth and Avalynn, Baylor, and Kai all exchange the same shit-eating smirk.

"You need to be pinned." Avalynn declares, loudly when the music abruptly switches over from indie-pop to rap; rap so fast she can barely make out the words.

Sloane ignores her.

"And Mel, fucking Mel. She's supposed to be handling the load calculations and she sends me this half-page mess at eleven PM last night, no math, no methodology, and has the nerve to say 'let me know if you want me to add anything.' Add anything? Add half of a fuck and some effort maybe?" Sloane presses her palms against her eyes, "I'm going to fail because of other people. That's how this ends. Four years of maintaining a 3.8 and I'm going to get a C in Structural Analysis because Marcus can't check his messages and Mel thinks Wikipedia is a legitimate source."

"You're not going to fail," Kai offers, though his attention is clearly divided, thumb brushing across Baylor's knuckles.

"You don't know that." Sloane accuses, eyes wide, mouth scented by the sour ale lingering against her tongue.

"I know you won't let yourself fail," he amends, "You'll just do their parts for them like you always do and then complain about it for the next three weeks."

Sloane wants to argue, but he's not wrong. That was exactly what she was going to do because passing meant more to her than failing to prove a point ever could.

Kai's right, which is annoying, but not as annoying as the fact that she'd known she was always going to do another person's share of work for them. She was always going to stay up until her eyes strained and her food went cold and her back ached from hunching over her laptop like some kind of gremlin.

Sloane has a GPA to protect. Her own points to prove past the unreliability of others.

Her mother had made the terms of her enrollment at Chicago-ITT clear the summer before freshman year while standing in their kitchen with her posture parade-perfect and her disappointment barely concealed beneath that calm, clipped voice of hers. She wanted nothing less than perfection from her defecting spawn; an exceptional GPA, perfect attendance, and the most proper of behaviors.

She needs to be mommy's good girl, the way Liam was her perfect boy. Liam who had graduated with honors and job offers out of Naval Academy regardless of his necessary service. Liam who just makes their insatiable parents proud in all the ways that mattered. Liam had followed the blueprint like a good soldier, like a good little unthinking *NPC*, and Sloane had taken her IIT acceptance and chosen buildings over service like that wasn't a slap in the face to four generations of Mairi military tradition.

Sloane sips her beer; a mango sour IPA. Sweet with a sharp twist like their mother's attitude when things didn't quite go her way.

Liam had always told her that she needed to do exactly what she wanted in order to live a happy, fulfilled life all the while doing the complete opposite of just that. He never even wanted to attend the Naval Academy, he just did because it kept their parents hyperfocused on him and not her.

So yes, she was going to do Marcus's section. And Mel's section. And whatever else needed doing to keep her name on that list.

She was far too gone in this route to make a stupid mistake in the name of pride and pointless dignity. Too deep in this to throw away the sacrifice he made for her.

"You're right." she mutters, grinding her teeth together along with her brother's stupid selfless rationalities.

Kai shrugs, because somehow he heard that beneath all the bass shaking glass and tables and people?

"You should knock the cobwebs off your pussy!" Avalynn shouts.

Sloane and Kai both wince when Baylor and Avalynn explode into a fit of obnoxious laughter; the couples in the booth over shoot them dirty, disturbed glances as if the volume of the music weren't shaking the whole fucking facility enough to drown out some hollering hoooligans,

"Sex won't solve these problems you whore." Sloane groans.

"It won't, but it's the perfect distraction!" the redhead insists, "Check your phone!"

Sloane's eyes begin to roll while reaching into her pocket, "Avalynn, for what?"

"For some spontaneous fun!"

The blonde unlocks her phone, blinking at the link sent to her:

*'Quick-Fix: meet singles in your area **tonight**'*

Sloane's eyes flare.

"Have you lost your fucking mind? Don't you remember the craig's list killer?"

She only yawns after lacing Sloane with a bored glare, "You won't even make a *tinder* account, or bumble, and you only use your insta to be hot and aesthetic. Therefore, *you* Sloane Mairi, have very limited options."

"I have two-hundred thousand followers and the whole country scrutinizing my every move. I can't go galivanting in people's inboxes, I have an image to maintain to keep the PR coming and my mom follows me." Sloane argues; she weighs it in her mind though, still, "Imagine she found out I was slutting it out via an exposure post?"

Guaranteed mediocre sex, or free stuff?

*Always* free stuff, unless you were a man or some freak who hated free stuff.

"Oh no!" Avalynn pulls away from Baylor, "The Chief of Staff's consenting, adult daughter participating in adult activities, oh me—oh my!"

"It's not my fault I love them enough to care about getting cut off."

"You can love them without them, Sloanie."

Sloane shakes her head, "I can show them I'm still perfectly worthy in another field. No need to do anything dramatic."

Avalynn would know. She'd been the one to torch her own bridge first. She traded West Point prospects for a camera and a subscription site, making more in a month than her father's pension could touch in his lifetime. Her family hadn't just disapproved; they'd erased her. No calls, no holidays, no acknowledgment that she existed outside of whispered gossip at military functions.

"You know my dad hasn't spoken to me in three years, right?" Avalynn says it casually, like she's mentioning the weather, "Three years since I told him I'd rather make six figures filming myself than salute a flag for his approval. And you know what? I sleep great."

Avalynn made cutting ties look easy, but Avalynn had been suffocating.

Sloane wanted her parents' approval and ultimately that's her problem. She didn't feel smothered; she felt conditional. Like her worth had an asterisk next to it.

There's a moment where there's just the bass of an ending song booming between the fours of them before adding:

"I bet a video with the two of us would make us millions."

Sloane retches dramatically.

"I'd rather salute the flag, but thanks." she hisses.

"Yeah," Avalynn groans, "no. Anyway, you really do need to like relax. You said it's only the beginning of the semester for you and you've got what, one exam and two projects already?"

"Yeah..."

"Then why not give yourself at least a bit of reprieve?" she insists, much to Sloane's dismay.

"Doing what?"

Avalynn's eyes roll upwards, "I already told you: *fucking.*"

Sloane drops her head against the back of her booth, "You're really not going to let this go?"

"You need some fun, a distraction," their waiter stops by their table and drops a second round of drinks onto the table, "a boy."

"Boys cause *problems.*" Sloane suggests, her mouth lingering aganist the top of her mug,

"Not if you're propositioning them."

Sloane clicks her tongue, "You know that sounds exactly like the kind of shit that would end with me getting disowned."

Baylor speaks up, no longer distracted by his and Kai's sidebar that had started some time ago,

"Who would find out?" He comments with a smug look, as if the rest of them were too dense to reach such an obvious conclusion.

"Not who, but when, Baylor." Sloane sighs.

"No one, because you're going to use that little website." Avalynn leans over the table with her margarita, "I use it all the time."

"But everyone knows you, there's glitter in hooking up with me and exposing me for it... remember?"

The scrutiny never stopped. Every move she and Liam makes gets dissected. Every person they touched got documented. Every moment of weakness got weaponized. Liam had never given them ammunition. Sloane had, and it had nearly destroyed her parents twice.

First through a video, then the audio recording.

Both clear enough to stop her father from renlisting and pursuing his career in politics.

Enough that her mother was actually concerned more for her and less with what she'd done.

The redhead turns her chin upwards, "Make it a contract, and make it with someone who has something to lose."
