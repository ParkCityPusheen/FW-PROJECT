# UNTITLED AU - Sloane & Dain

## THE PREMISE

Dain Aetos is a hermit-like, socially disconnected son of a successful brokering & acquisitions firm owner (mid-market in earnings). Struggling in the aftermath of his best friend's death, he posts an ad on a meet-up site out of desperation—not for anything transactional, but out of sheer loneliness and grief.

Sloane Mairi answers that ad. She's only on the site in the first place because of friendly goading from her best friend Avalynn, who uses the platform as a side gig for money while they both attend college. Sloane isn't there for the same reasons Avalynn is—she's there almost as a joke, a dare, until she stumbles across Dain's post.

Two people who shouldn't be there. One ad that changes everything.

**30, single male, will host after meeting for verification. Not here for what you think. Recently lost my constant. Looking for someone who'll sit with the variable. No solution required.**

## CHARACTERS

### Dain Aetos
- **Background:** Son of a wealthy brokering & acquisitions firm owner; in line to inherit the firm
- **Career:** Got into day-trading on a whim and found immediate success; has built on this using networking connections from his father's firm, which he also helps run
- **Education:** Degree in statistics and applied mathematics from Stanford (top donor alumni). Extremely mentally advanced—finished high school early, dual-enrolled in college, finished college early.
- **Age:** 30
- **Personality:** 
  - Extremely intelligent and highly logical
  - Pessimistic
  - Has a compulsive disorder that manifests in methodical, ritualistic behaviors regarding his space and cleanliness
  - Hermit by *choice*, not inability—he's extremely good at socializing and doesn't mind it, but prefers to remain quiet whenever possible
- **Sexual History:** Virgin at 30; very vocal in bed. Sloane eventually helps him explore his sexuality—and sometimes Aaric is involved
- **Sexual Conflict:** Very traditional and conservative when it comes to sex, but his *type* is not—this incompatibility is why he's been cheated on in the past. (This becomes a reveal to Sloane later in the story.)
- **Family:** All-American family. Very close with his parents, but only sees them during holidays (at his father's pleading). Always answers their phone calls, especially after Violet's death.
  - **Father:** Owner of a successful brokering & acquisitions firm (mid-market); Dain is in line to inherit. Obsessed with Dain's mother.
  - **Mother:** Successful ophthalmologist (now retired but still owns her practice and takes patients). Owner of Aimee Aetos—an eyewear brand that directly competes with Warby Parker.
- **Interests:** Loves other cultures and languages but has always felt too awkward to engage. When he finds out Sloane speaks Spanish, he's *enraptured*.
- **Current State:** Grieving the death of his best friend Violet; isolated and desperate for connection
- **Life Context:** Has spent most of his twenties doing exactly what he wants—he likes what he does and it makes him copious amounts of money. His life has been self-directed and stable (by design).
- **Key Detail:** NOT using the site for transactional purposes—genuinely seeking human connection
- **Relationship with Aaric:** Often seen with Aaric; their relationship is "questionable" but in a good way—lots of sexual tension
- **Living Situation:** Very spacious loft
- **Vehicles:** Two Porsches, both red
- **Mentor:** Cath—Dain drops everything for him at the drop of a dime; they share a father-son type bond
- **Volunteer Work:** Gives up his weekends to tutor mathematics and teach life-skills, personal financing, and budgeting to young adults from lower-income families. Some of these kids have him listed as their emergency contact—he takes this *very* seriously. Dain does NOT play about his students, and they LOVE him.
- **Relationship with Amber:** Has a clingy ex-girlfriend (Amber) whom he tolerates; his father doesn't like her and doesn't understand why she's still around

  - Extremely intelligent; naturally attuned to everything she decides she's interested in
  - Mind like a computer, similar to Dain—they're intellectual equals

- **Current State:** On the meet-up site due to Avalynn's friendly taunting/goading
- **Life Context:** Her life is much more hectic than Dain's, with heavier risks in more personal areas. She processes stress by struggling out loud—verbal processing, not chaos.

- **Key Detail:** The catalyst for Sloane being on the site in the first place

### Violet (Deceased)
- **Role:** Dain's best friend
- **Status:** Deceased (her death is the catalyst for Dain's isolation and his posting on the meet-up site)
- **Key Detail:** Her passing deepened Dain's connection to his parents via phone calls

### Aaric "Cam" (Supporting Character)
- **Background:** Dain's childhood friend and Stanford classmate
- **Relationship to Dain:** Frequently seen together; their dynamic carries a lot of sexual tension

- **Dynamic:** Father-son type bond

---

## SETTING

**City:** Chicago, Illinois
- Birthplace of the skyscraper; rich architectural and structural engineering history
- Major finance hub (fits Dain's business world)
- Significant economic disparity (context for Dain's tutoring work with lower-income families)
- Naval Station Great Lakes nearby in North Chicago (Sloane's brother stationed there)

---

## STORY DETAILS

### Key Conflicts
- **Political Divide:** Sloane's family is deeply tied to politics (military powerhouse); Dain's father is actively funding someone Sloane's family deems "a great evil." Sloane hates political speech and refuses to engage with it—but this revelation will force her to confront it. Major source of tension.

- **Communication Clash:** As they grow closer, Sloane feels Dain is severely undermining the things that stress her out. He sees her as dramatic and unorganized; she's actually stressed and actively working through it by struggling out loud (verbal processing). They'll need to learn each other's coping styles—his internal/controlled vs. her external/verbal.

---

## NOTES

**Family Parallel:** Both Dain and Sloane grew up with fathers who are completely obsessed with/devoted to their mothers. They've both been raised with that model of all-in, devoted love—even though their families come from completely different worlds (finance vs. military).
