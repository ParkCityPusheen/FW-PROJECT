### [Chapter 8](https://archiveofourown.org/works/63478354/chapters/165355825): Dain | Oath

Cath prods him through their wasteland, in the winds, and against the fabric of the flag; he tugs and pulls for Dain like he does when he wakes him in the mornings.

_"Do not sleep in the presence of your company, Knight."_ He growls,

He shuffles to, rolling the weight of his head from off of his neck, "I fell asleep?" he asks Cath aloud,

"Not really, if anything you started twitching and took a light nap. Are we still training tonight?"

It's still today, and she's still here, but Cath didn't share the _experience_ of his memory just now. He blows curiosity across Dain's mind as he thinks about it, though.

"Everything okay?" Sloane's looking at him with concern and mild suspicion, "You're so out of it recently, maybe you should take leave and get some rest."

"Can't," he stretches out, fully extending his arms and legs, his torso sinks against the back of the bench and pulls the tunic over his naval, "Three weeks."

She's staring at his waistband when he's done shaking out of the extension, "Then it'll be like we don't even know each other."

"No." his brows pinch above his nose, "I don't want that."

"I don't either." she blurts after him, dropping her legs down,

_"You need her."_ Cath coos,

"What do you want." Dain turns his body towards her, folding a leg underneath himself, "What do you want from _me_. I can tell there's something, we're just running around it."

He gestures to himself and her, pointing.

"You sound like you already know," her face falls and her eyes rush to their right, watching nothing and refusing to face him.

He opens his mouth dumbly, looking for the words to respond with but he only manages a blush, a deep red like Cath that snakes around the back and sides of his neck up to the tips of his ears.

"I'm asking _you_." He responds.

"And I'm telling you, to tell me!" Her eyes flare, "I can't fucking—,"

Dain takes her hand, he can feel his heart beating in his throat, "You don't have to rush into anything Sloane. I'm not leaving to go anywhere. I'll be right here in Tyrrendor with Violet, and you'll see me often." he brushes the back of her palm with his thumb, "We'll be right here."

Her trembling doesn't stop, he can tell she's focused on breathing so she can get the words out, her eyes blink rapidly and he watches helplessly as she wrangles internally.

"It's so much harder to hate you now that I know you."

"It doesn't change what happened. Navarre took everything from you," Dain focuses on her hand, on how small it is in his palm, the warmth of it, the flush across her knuckles, "then you were forced into the Quadrant and I took the last person that you had left on it's behalf."

Sloane sucks in a whimper, she's teetering on that edge of aggression and submission, trying to figure out if she walks away or faces him. Her eyes speak to him enough. He can feel her willingness to sit here with him even though she knows the feeling of comfort she finds in him is wrong. Her shoulders are tight with unease, lips pursed,

"I'll never stop apologizing to you for it."

She manages to meet his eyes, there's no tears there, just whatever intense feelings she's trying to convey, "I still want to blame you. I know you don't want to hurt me, but I _want_ to hurt you—and I know it's not right."

"You can. You _should_." He laughs, but its more a quiet whisper of a breath and his voice wavers, "If you need somewhere to put that feeling, put it on me. No one is going to hold it against you."

She finally pulls her hand out of his grasp and grabs it with her other, "You and Violet—,"

"We will never recover from the damage I've done. We can talk and ruminate all we want but that bridge is burned. Romantically, platonically; I ruined that too. I'm just in her good graces for now until I fuck up again, and finally." 

The look Sloane gives him bears no empathy, only pity. Pity the loner far home and bearing no relation to anyone anywhere. Pity him, sick and suffering on his own.

"You don't need to feel bad for me." He says confidently, "I'm figuring me out too."

What a woman Sloane Mairi is, concerned for Dain even through the grieving of her own family. He certainly doesn't deserve this consideration, his shoulders sag heavy with embarrassment, "I have Cath." Dain tells her proudly, "Cath is the one person in my life that _picked_ me."

Air blasts from her nose in a shocked snort, "This is why the two of you work so well together."

"That's what they say. I'm sure Thoirt treasures you just as much; you're both breathtaking."  He leans his side against the back of the bench, draping his arm over it towards Sloane, "But there's also you. You watched your family's execution, your friends, their families. Your home burned. All of it's gone. I'm not trying to make this a competition but please don't let this perspective you have regarding me shadow what you're actively going through,"

"Trust me, I'm not." She assures him, looking past him,

"I didn't think we'd ever be able to just.. talk like this. It's nice."

"Sure." she blanks, shrugging at him.

"So... was coming to my room..."

Sloane pauses, she wears surprise so well its unfair, "I realized it was effecting you, and I felt like I had some sort of exploitation opportunity over you." she pushes her palms outwards at him, "When I consider being kind or cruel to you, I want to be cruel."

"All right."

Her features break into mosaics of perplexity, _"All right?"_

"Take what you want from me, Mairi. I owe you that." he leans in towards her until he can feel her warm breath across his face, forcing her to look him in the eyes, "Whatever you want, if its from me I'll give it to you."

She stands up suddenly, almost head-butting him and he leans back in surprise, "I've heard enough. You seem unwell, so I'll go."

He can see the blush she's trying, and terribly failing to hide, he wants to badly to feel the warmth of it underneath his fingers, "Mairi." he calls, forcing her to turn around, "Tomorrow, I'll be around for sparring. I'll bring you some options, you just need to pick one."

She gives him a curt nod and bounds off of the terrace through the familial quarters doors.

---

Cath wakes him up early so he can retrieve his clean uniforms, including Riorson's, from service facilities. He showers, changes, and heads to the dining hall after quietly tidying his bed. Troy still sleeps silently, curled in a fetal position as the door clicks behind him.

"Dain!"

Dain recognizes Brennan's voice as he walks through rows of half full tables, he's just ahead of him having breakfast with Felix and two Captains.

"Good morning." Dain greets them, then sits down and starts at his eggs,

"Your signet." Brennan says immediately, leaning down so close his lips almost brush uncomfortably against his ear, "Do not tell anyone else you're reading memories without touching them. Not a fucking soul."

Dain looks over at him after he pulls away, and there's a smile there on his face. His eyes flick from person to person until they land on Felix who shakes his head. Felix is Aretia's Carr.

_"Is that a threat?"_ Cath bites, sleep obvious in his growl, _"__Tell him he will be my breakfast."_

He continues to eat his eggs.

"We've got a three hour slot for you and the fliers to get acquainted with Cath," Brennan begins, "Tomorrow will be a normal day, and then the day after you can start the tandem formations with the squadron if you feel comfortable."

"You've got a week left after that first day so really try and lock in." Felix adds, "I'll be observing; I want to see how you work in signets and gifts. If you decide to."

Dain wonders where they got their coffee from and looks over his shoulder at the serving line. He spots the steel carafes there and immediately makes for them. He grabs a mug and fill it to the brim.

_"You did not answer them."_ Cath warns,

Shit.

_"_Still _waking up."_ Dain confesses, he knows Cath will still—

_"Maintain your military bearing, Knight."_

_"I know Cath."_

He takes a long drink and tops off before heading back to the table.

"Sorry—"

"I'm the same way," Felix gestures to his mug, "third one already. And his fifth." He points to Brennan's empty one.

Dain gives Brennan a look of disgust, "Five?"

"Can't help it. These people stress me out."

Felix scoffs and folds his arms across his chest, "You are the most stressful thing that's happened in seven years actually." He runs his hand outwards the length of the dining hall that's filling with Cadets.

"I second that." One of the Captain's say.

"Same."

"Cope." Brennan snaps.

"Aetos," the red haired Captain begins again, "I'm one of the riders who volunteered. It's nice to meet you." He reaches behind Brennan to shake Dain's hand.

"I'm Thibodaux, and this is Abdullah. You can call me Daux, for short."

"Nice to make your acquaintances," Dain chirps. He's surprised they're so... kind?

"Our wives are Poromish." Abdullah adds, "They're retired fliers, they were watching you in the valley with me."

_"That explains it."_ Cath states.

"Everyone's excited for anything that puts us at an advantage in these stakes, dragons and gryphons working together might mean something bigger for the whole continent, not just the war." Daux speaks with his hands in tow gesturing every few sets of words, probably a habit.

"Your dragon doesn't mind gryphons?" Abdullah asks, scratching the scruff against his bronzed jaw.

Dain thinks for a moment to let Cath get his words in, but he's quiet, "He doesn't, the issue between dragons and gryphons is humans." _because Navarre taught it to them that way,_

"I agree." Felix pipes, throwing his hands up, "Thankfully you'll find Tyrrendor doesn't encourage the eradication of fliers and non-magic wielders who can go toe-to-toe with them."

"Yup." Daux says, "They're way more human than us too."

"In what way?" Dain asks across the top of his coffee mug,

"They cry openly, they're affectionate with their bonds... you'll see."

"Seems like you and yours get along just fine. Your flight maneuvers are literally the best I've seen, and that is _not_ a feat accomplished overnight, or even years." Abdullah comments, his grey eyes pierce right through Dain,

"I like to think we are." He feels a heated blush dragging across his face, "He's kind."

"You sound like a flier." Daux chuckles, "A proper rider's response would have been: 'but of course, they're a mighty dragon, hail Malek, death to those not superior'!" He dramatizes with flailing hands, 

"That mindset's been making me sick lately." Dain huffs through a mouthful of hashed potatoes,

"Good." Abdullah sneers, "All lives amount the same at Malek's door. It's not our place to gauge our peers value."

Cath sends a whipping wind of agreeance through the wasteland.

Dain looks down at his finished drink and food, "Let's head to the valley,"

"Up and at em'?!" Daux hollers, undoubtedly waking up the dining hall, "You heard the man Abdullah, let's go!" He claps the other Captain across his back and his coffee sloshes into his food from the mug,

"Amari's sake, Daux..."

---

The squadron is made up of five riders and ten fliers. It's a mass of personnel for a singular unit, and Dain does his best to remember faces and names. Abdullah and Daux know most of the fliers so the ice is broken rather easily; Dain only knows the four that were in his room. Adversely he does not know the other three riders: Jacobi, Torres, and Blue. They're all senior riders, First Lieutenants. Mira shows up too, she plans on watching, very closely.

_"Teine's is still ordered to rest."_

Ah.

_"She sounds like she plans to fly still?"_ Dain asks Cath, he onceovers Teine, the deep wounds from his capture mostly healed but still notably new.

_"And he plans to let her."_

Surprise washes over Dain's face as the squadron speaks with each other, their body language is more eager than anything.

"We'd benefit from any advice you have to give." He says to Mira, approaching her from her left, "If you don't mind."

She waves a small, wrapped notebook, "I'm way ahead of you, but thanks for asking anyway." Her smile is warm and appreciative, "I felt like you might think I was trying to steal your shine."

Dain gives her a look of indifference, "No, never. I hope to have your amount of experience in the next few years. What better way to learn than straight from the teacher?"

She pauses suddenly, then very gravelly asks, "Did you know?"

"Know what?"

"Riorson." she shuffles, but doesn't break the eye contact at the randomness of her question,

"No." The word leaves his mouth like a knife. He likes to think Violet had a legitimate reason for keeping it from him, but she didn't. Just that he _"is all reason and no ethics"._ 

"Nice to know I'm not the only person who feels disregarded."

She stalks off to Teine, "Get started then wingleader."

"Right."

_"You are evolving. Maybe she was right to not trust you at the time, fear often forces compromise."_

_"Maybe."_

He remembers her face when she told him way out in the valley away from other people, he had felt it in the shadows that saved them, so he already knew but _hearing_ how long it'd been a reality... That they all traveled in relative danger. How long it took Dain to calm down. Her silence after saying what she needed to. Tairn's body language as Dain rampaged with Cath eerily quiet next to him. Garrick's second signet...

_"Maybe I.. wasn't the person I thought I was to everyone."_

_"Some secrets are ones never meant to be told regardless, Dain."_

His eyes twitch. Cath only ever calls him by his name when he's being serious. When he's declaring law, when he wants something to not be a discussion.

_"Do you keep secrets from me?"_

"Good morning." Dain says to the squadron, motioning Mira to his side, "Now that we're all acquainted, let's get airborne."

Hours pass, and Cath doesn't answer.

---

Weapon's training in Aretia happens in the valley, like just about everything else. The culmination of magic and warmth creates a gathering of students and dragons, both bonded and unbonded. They hover above, watching at times, also stalking close. Cath is on the edge of the valley, at a cliffside that abruptly drops off into a grey, rock canyon with a handful of reds who gather intently in front of him, they're all younger than him. As usual, Dain hears bits of Cath's conversations because he lets him, but today his focus is Sloane. She watches Matthias make quick work of a third year from First Wing who's mistakenly challenged her with daggers.

He rounds their mat right as he's put on his back and she steps on his throat, "Aetos!" she exclaims, her eyes bulging at the collection of polearms he carries with him, "Yield." she barks impatiently, staring down until the third year concedes.

"Glaive, spetum, bow staff, battle-axe." he tells her, and looks over to Sloane, three mats down,

"C'mon Mairi, take your pick!" Matthias calls to her,

She bounds over quickly, jogging straight to Dain, "They look kind of heavy." she observes with raised brows.

"They can be after a while, you have to make sure you finish your fights quick, or be very intentional about your movements." he tells her, dropping them against the grassy valley floor,

"I think the glaive would be great for you, but what if start with the bow staff first? There's more by Professor Kiandra down the hill." she nudges towards the professor, "Sound good?"

Sloane lifts her hands in indifference, "The glaive looks cool... bow staff seems like a good starting point, let's do it."

Matthias moves to retrieve another bow staff and Dain stops her, "I'll grab it."

"Thanks?" Matthias says, watching him depart with curious brown eyes,

When he returns she has Sloane tired already, just from getting form down, a light sheen of sweet blankets her arms and face.

"Here, Matthias."

"Call me Rhi." she says, stopping her training abruptly to take the staff from him.

"...is that a request or..." he says in a confused stupor,

Her laugh spreads over the surrounding mats, "Yes wingleader Aetos, respectfully request that you address me formally as Rhi, or Rhiannon."

"All right. Rhi." He answers, her name feels odd in his mouth.

"Ugh, that's so much better."

She turns to Sloane and has the first year pick up the staff he brought her, "Have her take those to her room, they're hers." he adds as he moves to stand off at a distance,

"Really? Where'd you get them from?" Rhi asks,

"The watch armory."

"That's why they look so nice..." Rhi turns to Sloane, "You heard the man."

"That means I have to carry all of this back to my room." Sloane leans towards him in disbelief, irritation breaking through her facial features,

"Sure does." he admits, "You're welcome."

She scoffs, turning away from him. She's in her damn sparring uniform again and he gets his fill of her exposed naval, the lines of her abs showcasing her indented belly button. He blinks and looks up at the sun, hoping to burn away the slurry of inappropriate thoughts; it's impossible to hide erections in leathers.

He pops in and out of her sparring with Rhi, weaving between the two Wings, not saying much—which seems unusual to the other Cadets as he watches in relative silence, just nodding when they notice him.

_"You are quiet."_ Cath mentions himself, his head is turned in Dain's direction, and not the five reds ahead of him.

_"So are you."_ Dain chides, his voice cracks at Cath like a whip,

There's a rumble in the valley, Dain assumes it's some dragon, getting close somewhere so he doesn't look, but as the match in front of him comes to a halt, he follows their line of sight straight into Cath. He's so close one of his talons dig into the mat at the edge of the classes designated spot for sparring, he's about six sets down, watching Dain with narrowed eyes.    
     
_"Speak."_ he growls through the wasteland before tucking his head down low so quickly the Cadets he was watching dive off the mat thinking he'd rest his neck right on top of them,

_"Don't do this right now."_

_"No."_ his jowls crack open, and thick lines of saliva drop from his teeth, _"We will solve your problem now."_

_"My problem?"_ Dain's head rolls back to see past his dragon's snout into his golden eyes, _"Secrets? Right? If you have to keep them, keep them. No point in talking about what you can't tell me."_

No different than Violet.

What is it about him that's so fucking untrustworthy?

He walks away and his indignation causes Cath to explode a blearing screech at his back, he extends his wings and snaps them upwards in a display of aggression, _"Do not turn your back to me! Face me!"_

"How?! When you basically admit you've been fucking lying to me to and I have no idea about what?!" He chides, his voice hoarse and carrying across the valley as his peers scramble from around them, watching. He turns to face Cath, fists gripped tight.

_"What have I lied about?!"_ Cath roars, his scales raised,

"I don't know, and that's what I'm fucking saying Cath!!” He means to say it through their bond but for all things good and glorious he cannot wash the feeling that Cath might think Dain unworthy of his trust after all this time together.

His wings angle downwards, almost flat, _"Keeping things from you is not lying,"_  the red barks, eyes narrowing to dangerous slits as the others reds approach from behind him,

"That's rich. So what is it you're keeping from me?! The memories I've been agonizing over? Our weird ass magic? Maybe my nameless, faceless mother?!"

_"You did not ask about these things!"_ Cath bellows defensively, pulling his wings against his body,

"I have to ask for you to be honest with me when you can _feel_ that I need that from you?" Dain scowls, throwing his arms out, _"I don't keep things from the people I love."_ he hollers into the bond,

Cath's neck raises, showing Dain his exposed throat, _"I only keep from you things that will hurt you—"_

_"What in Amari's name is so abhorrent for me to know that you actively make a choice like that for me?"_ Dain begs, the hurt is curving into him like suturing needle,

_"I will tell you, but we—,"_ Cath has _never_ panicked in front of him, until now.

_"We?"_ the word is like bile stuck to the top of his mouth.

_"I cannot stand to lose you too. I will not!"_ The swordtail pushes his head into the ground, forcing it out across the mats and digging up the valley along his scales, dragging himself close until he shoves into Dain, pushing him gently, _"Since long before the human's Threshing you have been mine, you called to me! How could **you** forget?!"_

A wasteland.

_Where I met my first friend..._

That flickering red star beckoning him, those titanic ruby talons holding him, his garnet obelisk guardian watching him drink from the river, keeping him warm under his wings in the snow, and shading him with his body against stretches of salted beach. His mouth drops open from the weight of the realization. He didn't need Cath to tell him that, he _knew_, he was a child _talking_ to a dragon—the only way to understand them is through a _bond_. His brow furrows as Cath's panic peaks and begins to spill over into Dain's nerves.

_"How?"_ he gasps, clutching his heart over his uniform, _"I was a child, and a civilian."_

_"And I am a dragon. I will do as I please."_ Cath hisses so venomously it makes his jaw clench, _"You chose me, and so I chose you. You are my bond. Recognized by my den. I raised you, not that fool who you still allow to touch you, you wretched hatchling!"_

They stand there staring at each other, until Dain bleeds uncertainty into the wasteland. His eyes slam shut and he drops his head against Cath's curled lip.

"I'm sorry." He whispers, emotions flaring wildly,

_"There are things that you will not know. That is final."_

Dain sighs, his stomach still fluttering, _"..I don't like that."_

_"I do not care."_ Cath huffs against him, and his hair tousles wildly, _"But, when the time comes those things will be discussed."_

He takes several steps back, almost bumping into someone and he's too focused to care.

"Promise me. No matter what it is and how I might feel. You'll tell me." he demands once Cath's entire head fits in his field of vision.

Cath blinks at him, slowly: it's been _minutes_.

_"I give you my oath."_

Dain nods, _"All right."_

Cath talks to him about his childhood until he falls asleep that night.
