### [Chapter 2](https://archiveofourown.org/works/63478354/chapters/165354304): Dain | Abnormalities

The afternoon sessions in the sparring gyms are during more temperate weather; enough so that Dain takes his time opening nearly every window he can reach with his lesser magic. He does it swiftly enough as the other cadets file in, treading down the middle of the facility while flicking his finger to the right at each set of glass panes he points to. They flick open in a fluid sliding motion, one at a time until he reaches the end of the gym.

Naturally he knows Sloane is amongst them when he smells that sharp cut of citrus as it sneaks underneath his nose, carried by a warm wind that escapes through the now open windows.

He does a quick visual sweep of the gym first, part of his duties, making sure everyone's on time and accounted for. Tail Section is already paired off and working through drills; Flame Section looks organized, their squad leaders calling out formations. Claw Section is doing some sort of verbal breakdown before hitting the mats. All normal. All as it should be.

Then he gives in and glances over in her direction.

Sloane is stretching with Aaric, bent forward with one leg extended, her hands braced on her knee while Aaric does the same beside her. The movement pulls her training leathers taut across her back, and Dain watches the way her shoulder blades butterfly against her uniform.

It takes him a moment to realize he's no longer standing where he started; he's wandered across the gym, somehow ending up at the edge of her Squad's mat without a singular conscious thought. He looks down at his feet as if they've betrayed him, then back up at Sloane, who hasn't noticed him yet.

Dain watches from the edge of the sparring mat as Sloane gets thrown onto her back by Imogen, lands hard enough that he hears the impact of her shoulder blades against the mat. She barely has time to register the hit before Matthias is on her, pinning her down in a grapple that leaves her gasping.

They've wasted no time starting their training and he only has kind words and praise to give Matthias and Imogen at how efficient they are. They loom over her discarded body as she groans at the perfectly executed knockout before Imogen barks at her to fall back in line and try again; Sloane rolls over onto her front before pushing herself up with her legs—and he's standing *right* where she needs to fall in to spar again.

A second-year approaches Dain before he can move, asking about proper sword grip and how to adjust the pommel in his hand to change the weapon's center of gravity while swinging. Dain takes the cadet's staff, demonstrates the shift in weight distribution as he adjusts his grip along the hilt, then hands it back,

"Move your hand lower on the grip for heavier strikes, higher for faster cuts—feel how the balance changes? This is only a weighted staff so the motion won't be true, but the principle is the same."

"I meant to ask you yesterday, sorry Sir. I know now isn't the right time."

Dain shakes his head and passes the staff back, "Anytime is a good time."

He watches the cadet demonstrate the adjustment, nodding when the movement becomes fluid. The second-year thanks him with a grin before returning to their practice.

When Dain turns back, Sloane is still there, still watching him with that unreadable expression she's given him for a while now.

"I've been thinking," Sloane begins, sweaty after sparring with Matthias, "That you might only see me as a future liability."

She's gripping her sides pretty tightly, working through what must be bruised ribs. Her sparring leathers cling to her where sweat has darkened the impossibly black fabric; her hair has escaped its braided confines and the flyaways now stick to her neck and temples.

Today's one of the last hotter days of the season; Dain can feel it in the way the winds blow more strongly, how the nights are cooler and the mornings peak with faint warmth instead of a blistering flare. They hadn't spoken in two days, so Sloane initiating conversation hits him like an answered prayer.

He's been watching her all afternoon, caught himself doing it at least three times today and forced his attention elsewhere each time. Now she's standing right in front of him and he doesn't know what to do with his hands; his feet have already betrayed him, so he crosses them over his chest for safe measure.

"Are you still participating in that remedial training with Imogen?" he asks her, ignoring her previous statement, 

"I am." she wipes her face off.

"Great."

"If I agree to train my signet, will you stop being so fucking cryptic towards me?" she growls,

"Isn't he like that with everyone?" Lynx asks from behind them, already moving past with a wave at Dain.

"Shut up—" Sloane grits out, "and go away!" She swats at him but he's already too far, sauntering off to Aaric and Baylor with a laugh. "Will you?" she circles back and strains to straighten herself out, and the movement pulls Dain's attention to the rounding of her breasts, to the lithe silhouette of her throat.

"Sure." Dain agrees, anything to get her to train he'll do. "I'll tell you *some* things."

*Anything* to grant him the privilege of watching her work.

"Wait. Really?" Her mouth falls open, and he catches the way her eyes widen with something like surprise, maybe hope.

He's not sure what information Sloane is fishing around for considering he knows nothing about the most pressing matters at hand and especially that those matters pertained absolutely nothing to him. Violet seemed to only have told him out of guilt in lieu of Riorson, or to gauge his reaction and see if she felt Dain knew anything about missing riders, eggs, and dead elders.

Which he did not.

Because, again, who tells Dain anything who really know something, besides *fuck off* in different flavors on different days.

He turns to her, "Why not? It's best to do it with me—after all, I have a bunch of magic I can't utilize for anything."

_"Your power is not for just anything. You lecture the woman to train hers yet you do not do the same with your own. Ignorance."_ 

Cath’s scolding hits hard enough to make the insides of Dain’s ears itch.

"Next week," Sloane pants, "Next week, let's start next week, and in Aretia too."

Dain smiles, "Next week, and imbuing too."

She grimaces, "Can you even do that?"

"Of course I can."

Of course—he'd give her what she wants, or at least it ends up that way.

---

It's late on a Wednesday evening when she shows up at his door, well before her promised "next week," but Dain is fine with it. More than fine, if he's being honest with himself.

"We're doing this now?" he asks, though he's already moved to the side and gripped her forearm, pulling her into his room,

"I changed my mind," Sloane says simply, and there's something in her tone that suggests she's been thinking about this more than she wants to admit. "Anytime is a good time, right?"

"Right," Dain confirms.

Carr's disapproval of Sloane had been palpable for weeks now, escalating with each class where she intentionally chose not to wield and Dain knows the professor had threatened to remove her from Signet Sparring altogether if she continues refusing to participate. The consequence had been passed nonchalantly to him, in Carr's office just last week. Sloane doesn't know about it, and he's not planning to tell her. 

She has enough pressure on her already.

Dain pushes the thought aside as Sloane settles onto his bed, positioning herself with an ease that makes him think she's been planning this moment.

He doesn't move to join her on the bed yet, instead he leans against the edge of his desk, arms crossed, watching her with that analytical expression that makes her want to argue.

"Before we start," he begins, "I want to understand why you've been avoiding this."

It's a huge victory in his mind that Sloane arrived at all, yet alone early, and willing at that. Violet had been as eager as she had been at one point, but his denial of her autonomy had poisoned the relationship curated between the two of them and it spoiled faster than exposed fruit, cooking under the sun and heat of the expectations of the rider's quadrant. He decides to tread lightly here, taking himself back to that moment that Riorson forced Violet to accept her abilities rather than shunning them.

That's the path he'll follow here. Acceptance over avoidance. Trust over control. Sloane deserves better than what he gave Violet, and he'll be better this time.

She will *never* be a name on a death roll.

Sloane's hackles rise immediately. "I'm not avoiding it, I'm here, aren't I?"

"You're here because you think you have to be, outside of wanting to be ingrained in business that quite frankly has nothing to do with you or me." Dain counters. "Not because you *want* to train. So what's really stopping you from using your signet?"

"It's useless," she bites out, wincing, "and dangerous. Why would I want to practice something that could kill someone if I fuck it up?"

Dain tips his head forward; he understands her struggle. He'd hated his signet at first too, hated that he couldn't touch anyone without exploiting them against his and the victim's will. Eventually he got over it, even more quickly than he could have imagined when Cath became very vocal about how his treatment of himself and his signet reflected poorly on what he might think of his dragon. Rejecting the signet felt like rejecting Cath himself, and Dain couldn't bear that. He'd learned to accept it, learned that his power was part of who he was, part of the bond they shared. Surely Thoirt was feeling the same way now, watching Sloane refuse her own ability. Their bonds with their dragons made that rejection personal, and Sloane needed to learn the same lesson he had, before it damaged the bond she had with Thoirt.

"Could it? Or are you telling yourself that to justify not trying?"

*"Well said."* Cath mumbles, his heavy voice laced with fondness that makes Dain's heart feel light.

Then he remembers the time Cath launched him out of his seat over the Parapet to prove this same exact point; his swordtail remembers right along with him,

*"And you still deserved it."* Cath growls.

Sloane shoots to her feet, hands balled into fists. "You don't know what you're talking about. You think I'm just being difficult, but you have no idea what it's like to have a signet that only works when you're taking power from someone else. It's parasitic."

"It's a tool," Dain says, his voice steady even as hers rises. "Like any signet. And you've used it successfully before."

Sloane's eyes shrink on him, "Is that what they told you about yours?"

"They did, and I adapted. Didn't want to be another dead Inntinnsic."

Dain observes as she soaks in his honesty. There's no point in running from her jabs when he understands how this all sounds coming from him; it couldn't be less important in the grand scheme of things. He needs to get her wielding and fast, because just like any other mind signet, Sloane could be determined a liability and put down all the same.

"I don't have a choice—"

"In Aretia, for Mira," Dain interrupts. "You siphoned from me, and it worked perfectly. Brennan was able to use that magic to save her life. That wasn't luck, Sloane, that was control."

"I didn't have control then either," she snaps. "I was panicking. I just—I had to try something, and it happened to work."

"Did it? Or did you know what you were doing that time?"

Sloane freezes, and Dain sees a shift in her expression, her defensiveness giving way to something else. Something raw.

"It only worked because you were there," she says, voice breaking slightly, "you were guiding me through it, telling me what to do. You were the one who knew how much to take, how to direct it. Without you there, I would have fucked it up completely. I would've killed you if you didn't know what you had known."

Dain's expression softens, but his voice stays firm. "I only provided you with the route, Sloane. You controlled the flow, you managed the transfer. That was all you on that path all on your own."

"Bullshit. You were there. You were helping me. That's the only reason it went well. If I'd been on my own, if I'd had to figure it out by myself..." She trails off, sinking back onto the bed, her shoulders slumping. 

"I can't do it alone. I don't trust myself to do it alone."

The instinct rises unbidden in moments like these. In the past, he would have pulled Violet close, covered her in gentle pecks and cooed and cradled her like a precious child, protecting her from anything that might cause pain. He can feel that same urge now, to wrap his arms around Sloane and shield her from the weight of her own doubt. But he understands now that approach was wrong, that it only kept Violet weak, kept her dependent on him. 

He wants to empower, not to enable.

No part of Sloane should be dependant on anyone. She bore the potential so sap the life out of any threat with the swipe of a finger. Power like that sang independence and fury, not gentle passiveness and protection.

He needs to strip her down to her most exposed layer and attack her there, to show her she's perfectly capable of handling herself. The yearning to comfort her battles with the knowledge that comfort won't help her grow. She needs to be pushed, needs to face her fear head-on, or she'll never realize her own capability. At Sloane's discretion she would answer Amari or Malek for her offenders. That's the kind of power that demanded respect, demanded trust in her own abilities.

"That's what we're going to change," Dain reassures her, gently as he can, moving to sit beside her, close enough that their shoulders nearly touch. "We're going to practice until you trust yourself. Until you know you can do it, with or without me."

It's softer than he wants, but he prays she takes the bite, prays she accepts this so that they can at least develop some sort of baseline.

He kicks himself inwardly, though; had he offered this guidance to Violet he wonders if he could've avoided hurting both of them the way that he had. If he had embraced the the risk and pushed forward instead of away to a place that promised safety away from the contrast of discomfort, would her brother be alive?

How many aspects of himself did he need to change to makeup for the pain he caused?

"I don't know if I can," Sloane admits, and her voice is small, so vulnerable, that Dain has to fight the urge to reach for her hand.

"You can," he says firmly. "And you will. We're going to practice until you trust yourself."

Sloane looks at him then, really looks at him, and nods slowly. "Okay."

Dain pushes himself up from the bed and moves to clear space on the floor, pushing the table aside and gathering one of his pillows off of his bed, then tossing it on the floor and gesturing for her to sit. He positions them so they're facing each other, close enough that they'll be able to work together, and Sloane follows his lead, settling onto the floor across from him without ceremony. She pulls her legs up into a cross-legged position, and Dain mirrors her.

"Right, then. Wingleader. What should I do?" Sloane exhales, eyes avoidant and hidden beneath gold lashes,

"Start simple, just pull for starters, take from me what you will. Then, you could try putting what you take into this dagger." He unsheathes a dagger from where it it had been kept against his thigh and places it on the floor beside them,

"How much?"

Dain chuckles, "As much as you want."

*"She couldn't handle all of you."* Cath remarks, irritated at Dain's casual answer.

Dain rolls his eyes after making sure Sloane is focused on his body and not his face, *"Not now, but eventually."*

Cath is quiet for a moment, *"Longer than eventually, Hatchling."*

*"Stop calling me that."*

Dain doesn't argue, he only knows how to measure his strengths against a timeline, not Sloane's.

Her hands find his wrists and she pulls them to the middle of where they sit, inhaling deeply before activating her power. She siphons Cath's magic from him bit by bit, until sweat beads at her hairline and his toes feel warm, but sting as if they've fallen asleep. Sloane's signet makes his body feel like a block of ice rolling down the sandy dunes of a desert. He can't really describe the sensation, but it makes every damned inch of his skin tingle with heat as his insides freeze over.

*"She could take more."* Cath groans, *"You have plenty, show her what I have given you."*

*"You're distracting me."* Dain hisses, chastising his Red, Cath only becomes more irritated,

*"She takes so little I can hardly sense it leaving you."*

Dain pauses, eyes closing to ground; Cath is right, what Sloane takes is miniscule. One of his eyes peak open to note her condition: she seems exhausted already.

He watches her carefully, noting how her breathing has shifted, become shallower. Her hands on his wrists are steady but he can feel the faint tremor running through them. The sweat at her hairline has spread, beading along her temples now, and there's a tightness around her eyes that speaks to concentration, or maybe strain. She's taking so little from him, barely a trickle, but her body is responding as if it's much more. 

Her jaw clenches, and he watches the muscle there work as she focuses. The magic flowing through her must feel intense, because every few seconds she has to pause, her grip tightening momentarily before she forces herself to continue. It's like watching someone carry something too heavy for them, their body protesting with every step even though they refuse to put it down.

The exhaustion is visible now, settling into the lines of her face, her shoulders curve forward slightly under some invisible weight. And when she begins pushing against her limits, he swears he can feel it.

Sloane opens her eyes and grabs the dagger beside her. Dain uncrosses his legs and scoots towards her so that she's nestled in-between them. He looks up and realizes he's neglected to take note of their proximity when his lips nearly graze hers.

"This okay?" He mutters, reaching his arms out behind him and leaning back onto his palms to give her space.

"This is fine." She holds the dagger in one hand and places her other hand openly against his thigh, then she closes her eyes again, exhaling.

The sensation is completely different this time, and when Dain closes his eyes he can *see* the flow of his magic racing around the shape of his body and into the dagger. It files in through the leather handle and then rams to the tip of the blade, some catching against its shape, but most of it spilling away from the opaque outline.

"Can you... see that?" Dain asks her, opening one eye just a bit.

Her face scrunches, "See what?"

"The magic?"

He observes her with a quick glance. Sloane's eyes are like lakes hidden behind perfectly golden-yellow foliage, "Where are you seeing it? I mean, I can feel it..."

Dain closes his eyes and focuses. 

He can especially see the swirling iridescent movement of magic being pulled from the core of his body, through Sloane's hands and into the dagger. Its unmistakable, like when handling runes, he can see it as much as he can feel it leaving his body. He swears there are oil slicks of coloring, but he can't be sure. But he feels like he could just... drain it all away if he tried, like he could steal it back,

"It's just here, in front of us..."

Suddenly, he feels the unpleasant shock of pain through his thighs up into his chest. The sensation is so powerful that he groans and clutches the fabric of his uniform over his breast and chokes in a sharp gasp,

_"Gods, fuck!"_ he snarls, squinting his eyes,

Sloane panics in front of him, "Shit! I forgot to focus on the the quantity trying to see what you were seeing." She's rambling, not even looking at him,

"It's fine, it scared me more than anything." He sits up a bit and rubs the back of his neck, "You've been focusing on the quantity?"

She gives him a look he can't quite decipher.

"I..." she takes a deep breath, "I hate this power. I really do. But Thoirt is fond of me. At least it feels like she is, more than other riders and their dragons, and I don't want her to ever think my disfavor towards my ability is directed at her."

She pulls away from him entirely, "I spent the last few days thinking about all there is to a siphoning signet. I went to the archives even, but there really wasn't much in specifics to it like there is with more common signets, you know, like wind, fire, and ice wielders. It's all just _give and take._ And imbuing."

Dain lets her finish, scared to disturb the progress she's letting him in on. He feels pride bubbling up in his chest for her and fights back a smile.

"I thought about the few times I've siphoned. Specifically from you and General Sorrengail."

"What'd you come up with?" he mumbles, looking away, he can tell they're both uncomfortable.

"For starters, I can control it when I want to, when and where, off and on." She lets go of his thigh and he immediately misses the heat of her hand, "Like a valve. But when I siphoned from General Sorrengail, it felt like she was pushing her power into me."

Dain looks at her face to cue her continuation.

"It was overwhelming, but then it happened with you too, with Mira. It's like you guys were willing the magic into me, faster and harder. And Brennan just absorbed it all so easily... But I discovered amount I give and take have to be in proper ratios, and it depends on the person too. Otherwise one of us could get hurt."

Her training continues like this. *Silent.* 

"Is there a reason why you like sleeping in here?" he blurts; the question leaves his lips as he generates it in his mind and he almost bites his tongue asking.

Sloane's eyes grow wide and she rips her hands away, "Do I need a reason?"

"...I would think so?" he responds, incredulously.

"Well..." she closes her eyes and inhales deeply.

"We need to address what happened in Athebyne." he clears his throat, "Or at least I do."

Her brow furrows, "There's not much to talk about. You snitched, my brother died. I get it."

"I didn't mean—I told my father, I told General Aetos about some concerns I had regarding conversations she had had with Riorson, that I accidentally saw, because I wanted to prove she wasn't involved in whatever was going on at the time."

Finally her eyes snap open, and she fixes a disgusted leer on him,

"Why do you feel like you need to explain yourself to me right now? And after you let me blame Violet for *months.* She would never hurt me."

Dain looks away.

"I know," he stammers, "I know she wouldn't, I wouldn't hurt you either. I never mean for any of this to happen, I swear."

Sloane's signet stops abruptly and that same pain shocks through him, leaving him breathless and grasping at his chest.

"But it did, didn't it?"

He nods.

"I'm sorry."

"I know, and unfortunately you apologizing for the rest of your life will never make it forgivable."

---

Cath wakes up Dain at brink of dawn and he reluctantly pulls himself to the edge of his bed scratching at his scalp as if it'll sand away the words she pressed into him before leaving his room the night before.

Achieving forgiveness was a true false. Absolutely unachievable. That was fine, it's not like he deserved it anyway.

His Red swordtail attempts to soothe him, in his Cath-like way of course.

*"You will make mistakes."*

Dain groans, standing up to trek to the bathing chambers, *"Ones that cost innocent people their lives?"*

*"Yes."*

*"Right. Thanks for that."*

Dain snorts, he shields the rest of the morning, brushing his teeth in silence, sneaking to the dining hall for coffee, and then slowly trailing through the rotunda and staying there quietly until just before formation.

Outside feels pleasant enough. He huddles in with the rest of leadership at the dais, its takes all of fifteen minutes for the rest of quadrant to appear. Hordes of cadets in rider black, quiet but still complaining. Naturally, he glances back and over Flame Section and sees Sawyer sleepily staring up at the sky. Ridoc, Imogen, and Matthias are all working their way into formation with Violet at their heels.

He receives Maiselle's muster report from another third year that he's sure was part of First Wing, until he opens his mouth and Maiselle's voice rings into his ears with reassuring familiarity.

Roll is reported up the chain and then formation breaks.

Tactics, maneuvers, and physics pass peacefully.

During sparring he tries his best to casually observe his sections and their respective squads, but he can't help noticing Sloane's flushed features and sloth movements. She's swaying, or trying not to; he notices immediately that her motions lack the confident bravado she typically moves with. There's no swing in her hip, no sway from her braids, and even those twin plaits are uncharacteristically woven haphazardly.

Dain wonders if he should leave it be and let her fend for herself. She might've been a participant in some unsurely after-hours fun that left her feeling drowsy, but something about how she's just standing there with her face turned up to the sun is... *wrong.* His stomach knots into itself, instinct screaming to pull her out of class.

Then finally, when she's called to the mat for her challenge his feet are moving faster than his brain,

"What's wrong?" he asks, blocking her path before she reaches the mat, then grabbing her face with one hand and turning her head side-to-side, "Why are you sweating like that?" 

She feels damp, and the moisture that creates harsh highlights along the sweat that pools above her cupid’s bow.

"I don't know," she rasps, "Keep throwing up. And don't *ever* touch my fucking face,"

His features screw up in confusion as she swats his hand away with a concerning lack of force.

The movement draws attention from nearby mats. Ridoc pauses mid-swing to look over, and Imogen's head turns at the sound of Sloane's weakened voice. Matthias shuffles closer, concern written across her face.

Dain can only imagine what they think he might be doing as Sloane pulls away from him. How it must look from the outside—his hands pulling away from her face, her recoiling. The optics are terrible, and he knows it.

"Sloane?" Matthias asks, voice soft, "What's going on?"

Violet breaks from her own sparring partner and steps toward them, her brow furrowed, eyes mostly on *Dain.* 

They don't need to talk to acknowledge how well they know each other, they haven't in weeks now and they hardly spoke the few months they were gone together with the rest of Quest Squad. Still he *knows* that look, he's completely familiar with the suspicion behind it, the wariness. It's the same way she'd looked at him in the interrogation chamber. His stomach twists. She thinks he's doing it again. Controlling. Overstepping.

Being the villain.

Their eyes meet for half a second, and Dain feels the shame crawl up his spine. He breaks the contact first, stepping back, giving Sloane space. Proving, *Gods* always proving, that he's not that person anymore. He's changed.

*"You have always been a good person."* Cath barks, his voice booming through Dain's head.

Dain's eyes stay locked on Violet's person; he wants to blather, to beg her understanding as she slowly stalks towards them, sweating from the grappling she had been doing with Imogen,

*"Don't you dare do anymore groveling for her. You have done enough."*

Cath's tone is far from suggestive and in the distance Dain hears him, that unmistakable sound that is Cath; a long cry that shakes the windows of the gym and forces them all to glance behind their shoulders at the direction it came from.

*"I won't, I'm just backing off so no one is suspicious of me, that's all. Just deescalating."*

"Why the fuck would you not say something?" Aaric growls at Sloane from a mat over. He has Lynx in a nasty headlock, but his focus is entirely on Sloane now.

"I'll take her to the healers, hopefully it's just a stomach bug." Matthias says, already moving to ease her body against Sloane's for support.

Dain doesn't say anything, but he feels Sloane's hand touch his fingertips so lightly that he wouldn't have noticed if it hadn't been for the dampness blanketing her skin,

"Your room, after brief." she croaks, its almost as unnoticeable as the touch.

As she's assisted by her Squad Leader to the Healers, Dain feels eyes on him still and turns to meet Violet's multicolored gaze.

"I know you weren't." she tells him, face stern with apparent understanding.

*"Don't you dare entertain that, Hatchling. She is not your superior."*

He considers what Cath is hollering and offers her a curt nod, then spins on his heels to watch a different section.

Maybe Cath is right; he has done enough.

---

By the time Battle Brief rolls around, Dain's still chewing on what happened. The way Sloane barely managed to stand, swaying in place suddenly when she couldn't keep up with the facade of being in good health. Then, the brush of her fingers against his, how damp they were, and the hoarseness of her voice.

If she'd come down with whatever had ailed him frequently the last year he's rather impressed at how well she masked it. It had left him without appetite, sleepless, and miserable. Shortness of temper be damned, he didn't even want to speak with is own dragon some days. His eyes roam pointlessly, focusing on the edge of the dais when he spots Matthias making her way up the stairs directly towards him.

She's much earlier than usual, not that she was ever late, but this was far from her usual point of punctuality and she spots Dain she acknowledges him with a nod, smiling only out of courtesy. He's surprised when she passes the center seating where she typically sat, and instead makes the journey to the last row of seats at the highest point of the chamber.

"Aetos," she begins, shuffling through the few others in her way to sit next to him, "They don't know what's wrong, Winfred sent for Nolon and he told me to come back to class."

Dain glowers; Nolon's a fucking rat, "Is it... a cold?"

Matthias is quiet, "I don't think so, Winfred said she had 'withdrawal-like' symptoms."

"I wonder if she pushed herself too far last night." He mutters aloud.

"Wait, is she actually training her signet?"  Matthias inquires, eyes glittering.

He looks up at Matthias and smiles, "Yeah, she is. And surprisingly she has been on her own too."

He pauses, and the thought creeps in uninvited—*he's* been sick too. Not the fever kind of illness, not something that came and went, more like a constant hum under his skin. An ache. Since last year, since that interrogation chamber with Violet and Varrish, since he stopped using his signet entirely.

He remembers the first time Cath truly reamed into him about it.

*"You treat your power like it’s poison,"* Cath had hissed as Dain sat alone in the flight field with him, *"hoarding it like some cursed thing; that’s not restraint. That’s cowardice. It is fear."*

Dain had said nothing because what could he say? That it was a curse? That every time he reached for it, it burned hotter, stretched further, echoed longer? That it didn’t feel like his anymore? That it was beyond the point of control; his signet was getting stronger and evolving against his will. Using more of his magic and delving farther into the minds of others,

*"Magic must move, Knight,"* Cath had continued, slower now, crueler for the calm. *"It’s not meant to sit dormant. You dam it up long enough, and it turns back on you. Yours floods your vessel and rots it from within."*

At the time, Dain thought it was dramatics. Just more dragon-speak. But now, watching Sloane shiver and burn in the aftermath of a power she didn't want, he wonders if Cath's warning was applicable to them *both.*

Matthias brightens in her seat, "That's great!" grabbing his shoulder and jerking him out of the memory, "Thank you. I should've been able to get through to her."

Dain manages a weak smile before his expression sobers. "You can't bear all the blame, Matthias. I've been sick too. I think." He admits, pushing back the thoughts of his... *rotted* magic, "She probably got it from me."

"Withdrawal isn't a symptom of naturally occurring illnesses, so highly unlikely. Maybe it is the training? What did you guys even do? You haven't seemed ill to me."

Matthias is ever observant, a Wingleader in the making; her concern for her peers is valiant. Dain refocuses on the issue at hand.

"We know she siphons my power well enough, so I just let her take as much as she wants. She mentioned focusing on specific amounts, and then she attempted imbuing." He answers, not missing a beat.

"You just let her... siphon your magic?" Matthias inquires, curiosity brimming in her eyes,

Dain nods, "Yes. Until she chooses to stop."

"Brave of you." the Squad Leader comments before shrugging, "Did it work?"

He thinks about it for a second—how the blade had hummed in her grip, the edge catching light it hadn’t before.

It felt different. Not alive, but not empty either.

“Kind of,” he admits. “It’s retaining some magic. Just not sure if it's useful yet.”

"What are you two on about?" Imogen interrupts, with Violet close behind.

"Sloane," Dain and Matthias answer in synchronized concern; the two of them sit right after Matthias, Catriona sits to his left and makes no attempt to participate in the conversation being had.

Imogen leans past Matthias to eye Dain.  "Is she feeling better?" she asks, concern playing into her sharp features,

Matthias releases a tortured groan, "I'm not sure, I'm going to check in on her after we get out of battle brief."

"I know as much as you all do." Dain admits and a resigned sigh slips out of him as Imogen leans back in her seat.

*"Do you think my magic made her sick, since it's been making me sick?"* He asks Cath; it seemed like the obvious reason for his sudden relief. She siphoned whatever he had come down with.

*"I am not certain, but... Today you do seem less burdened."*

They share a silents pause then Cath adds: *"Unfortunately you've become accustomed to operating in horrid conditions, so it's hard for even me to tell anymore."*

Dain grins inwardly, happy that he's managed to to hide at least one thing from his dragon; turns out Cath can't sense *all* of his shields.

*"Can illnesses even be siphoned? Isn't siphoning just a means of conducting and transferring magic?"*

*"I wouldn't believe so."* He hurr-umphs through the bond, *"The medicinal ones should be able to discern it. However signets can effect both mind and body in their own way, who knows how hers works. Obviously she does not."*

"Does she have a fever? In the middle of the summer?" Sawyer wonders, approaching from Dain's left with Ridoc, who's laughing.

"Yeah right now is awful timing, rotation is soon." he comments, slapping Dain on the shoulder while passing for Violet.

Dain frowns, "Hopefully she's feeling better by then."

"Gods know how upset she'll be if she doesn't get to go home this weekend." Imogen says, twirling her ink pen against her fingers.

Like *fuck* he was leaving Sloane in this death and venin-infested school without anyone to help watch her back.

"We'll have to carry her." Dain says, plainly, and all of their heads twist in his direction as he settles into his seat and Professor Devera appears at the Dais below.

"Yeah dude, good luck convincing Cath, Aotrom already told me to get fucked and I haven't even asked."

"I think I'm asking for too much already," Sawyer mumbles, gesturing to his leg.

Imogen shakes her head and past her Violet is grimacing at her hands folded in her lap—Tairn is definitely telling her no.

*"Would I be out of line asking this of you?"*

Cath's end of the bond is full of wonder.

*"No. It shall be done."* he states simply.

Dain's eyebrows shoot up, "We've got her."

Violet speaks up from beside Imogen, who looks just as exasperated, "Really?"

"Are you sure Cath is a Red?" Matthias gasps, she's giving Dain a long sideways glance,

"I feel like Cath is the most chill dragon on the Continent; I mean Tairn let Riorson put a saddle on him, but I doubt he'd let anyone else ride him but Violet." Sawyer whispers to Dain; as if Cath won't hear him.

And he does.

*"Do not compare me to that brute or the savage he mates."* Cath bellows.

Dain chortles, kicking his legs out as Devera begins her lecture and they all look at him with raised brows.

---

*"Your favored one approaches, young Knight."*

Dain shoots up from his desk, dropping the ink pen he'd been torturing for the last two hours. 

Reflective reports from second years following their staggered RSC rotations lay scattered across the surface of it, most of them repetitive accounts of the cold, lifestone in Basgiath's interrogation chambers, rationed supplies while working alongside infantry, and near-misses with un-bonded dragons. He'd read the same paragraph three times while unable to focus, checking the corridor every few minutes. It had gotten dark outside hours ago, and he'd even bathed and retired his uniform, trading leathers for loose cotton that did nothing to ease the restless energy coiled in his chest.

*"I do not favor her."* he swears, eyes narrowing at the ceiling of his dorm room as if Cath were looking at him through it. 

*"And I,*" the swordtail sneers, *"do not breathe fire."*

"Sloane," he says, opening the door before she can knock, he holds out his hand and offers her a skittish smile.

"Hey," the blonde responds without looking at him, only taking his hand and allowing him to pull her through his wards.

She still looks awful, and eyes squint at the mage lights.

"How are you feeling?" He wills the lights to dim, then looks over at Sloane, "Get on the bed."

She complies and flops down once she's near the bed. She's in her sparring uniform. A clean one.

"You changed into that?" He asks, confused.

"I was sweaty and smelled revolting; didn't want to come here and stink up the place." she flops a hand up that falls back towards the mattress no sooner than it's raised, "Then I realized halfway here that I changed into this and not my sleeping gown."

He gets up and grabs a shirt from his armoire. Its a soft cotton t-shirt that's been dyed a deep maroon, bought from a generic clothing store in Caldyr.

"Want to wear this?" He asks her, offering it with an outstretched hand, face lighting up when Sloane takes it.

"Do you mind turning around?" she says, scooting to the edge of the bed.

"Nolon says my body is 'overrun' with magic and when I tried imbuing it out at his suggestion I felt a bit better but nothing really changed. Afterwards I felt even sicker with it gone."

Dain frowns. Overrun?

She'd taken so little from him tonight—Cath had even complained about it, said he could barely sense it leaving. But now she's overrun with magic?

"So it was me." The words come out easily enough, and he listens obsessively when the rustling of her movements stops altogether, 

"I think maybe our power is too much for you to train with."

It's only an inkling, but the pieces don't fit otherwise.

She'd siphoned a fraction of what he has, what Cath has given him, and her body is reacting like she'd drained him dry from the diagnosis Nolon has given. Either his magic behaves differently once it's in her system—expanding, resisting her control, or the sheer concentration of it is too dense for her to process. Like trying to drink from a river versus drinking from the ocean; same action, different composition and reaction.

He listens to the rustling of her uniform when she starts moving about again, and he *does not* imagine the little wiggle her hips would do while shimmying out of it.

"How'd you arrive at that conclusion?" She insists.

"But if that was the case why didn't this happen in Aretia?"

Dain thinks for a moment, listening to her clothing hit the bedroom floor.

"...the other two times I've known you siphoned you hadn't reacted like this. That's my thesis, naturally, but also Brennan being there to receive the excess magic meant it carried straight through you to him, like a conductor of sorts. Same theory can be applied to the ward stone and General Sorrengail; you siphoned and pushed the magic straight into the stone, keeping none of it. Right?"

He hears the bed creak, a telltale sign that she's climbed into it, but Dain doesn't turn around.

Sloane sighs, "Right."

"And Brennan wasn't sick at all when we went back to Riorson House; Lillith... fulfilled her service."

More softly this time, Sloane agrees, "Right."

"Siphoning herself *and* her dragon to fire the ward stone was a much, much larger quantity of magic that you had moved, and much more powerful. You've barely taken a morsel from me."

"No," Sloane insists, "I took enough that I thought it would have some sort of effect on you, but you're fine..."

"I see."

*"Is your power that strong?"* He asks Cath through bond.

*"Our power is not like others, young Hatchling."*

*"What do you mean?"*

*"Magic processed through myself is not quite as it once was after I have harnessed it."*

*"Is it not magic anymore then, once you've... harnessed it?"*

*"It is as it should be."*

Dain shakes his head as Cath's presence retreats from their bond.

What the *fuck* does that even mean?

"I'm done." Sloane says.

She's folded her clothes neatly and set them on the nightstand, and now lays fully on her side, sprawled across his bed. His shirt is bunched up just below the curve of her ass, exposing her long, toned legs and he wishes for a split second that the bed was in the middle of the room so he could chance a peak by the armoire. Either way, he takes in the sight of her freckled clavicle just as graciously.

"I don't think our... magic... properly leaves your body if you aren't... pushing it into _someone_ else. Maybe we should ask Mira how she felt afterwards."

"But once I siphoned your magic, Brennan _used_ it to mend her. So it would've been his power harnessing yours... right? Do you think the properties of your magic remain the same when someone else utilizes it?"

"I'm honestly not sure. These aren't aspects I'd typically need to consider when pondering signets."

She raises an eyebrow at him, "I thought you knew a lot about siphoning? You walked me through it with Brennan."

Dain's eyes snap to hers.

She's still very flushed, and her current docile nature is unsettling.

"Well I just..."

The memories blast through his body like a crossbolt, and Dain shudders. He remembers the amount of time Naolin put into understanding his signet, the years of training and dedication needed keep Brennan safe. He could explain siphoning and imbuing so flawlessly to Sloane because Naolin explained it to Brennan. At the time he could see it, *hear* Naolin's voice in his mind like he'd been there in the room with them, watching the Siphon walk Brennan through the mechanics of signet, the control required, the risks, both learning together.

But now he can't make out the details as clearly now as he could then.They're fading, slipping away like like his free time if he'd ever gotten any.

And he never touched Naolin.

He never touched Brennan.

The realization hits him in his solar plexus, cutting off the breath he'd been taking in. He'd pulled that memory without contact, without even meaning to. Just from being near Brennan, from the conversation, from proximity alone, from the pressure of the situation and possibly his desperation. He's taking from others without permission, without him even trying.

*It's evolving.*

Dain covers his mouth and leans down against the desk, pushing the unnecessary thoughts away, pushing down the panic threatening to escape out of his throat.

"Are you okay? You look... pale." Sloane asks, anxiety laced in her words,

Dain takes a steadying breath, forcing himself to focus. The acknowledgment receds, leaving behind only the lingering chill. He reaches down the bond briefly, grounding himself in Cath's presence, then looks back at her.

"Just remembered something." He shifts the subject, "When I asked you if you could see the magic, you said you couldn't, right?"

"Yeah."

"When you were siphoning our magic I could feel two distinct flows: yours, and mine. They run like a circuit that encompasses our bodies, but wherever you're moving the magic to, it takes the shape of that object for a moment. But not entirely."

He stands, stationary at his desk but spins the chair to face her, then sits again with the back between his legs.

"When you were siphoning us into your dagger, it was working but I could feel where our magic was also being... pushed through the top of it. Like it was too much, or just spilling out I guess."

"It doesn't help that you can track *my* ability."

Dain chuckles, "Right? I guess maybe we'll have to do some training with some controlled variables and take notes."

"Ugh." She whines, "I don't know, this feels like shit. And this still doesn't make sense. I can feel magic when I shape runes. I'm Tyrrish, its second nature to me. I'm a Mairi."

He watches her eyes flicker around in defeat.

"Or at least it should be."

"Sleep in tonight, I'll report you limited duty at formation tomorrow, but do you think you could drop in for Signet Sparring?"

Sloane's head turns against the mattress, "Here?" She's taken aback by his suggestion.

"I can leave if you want." he offers plainly.

"No, it's fine, but can't we all just come here?"

"Absolutely not." Dain snaps, "For one, I make an exception every time I let you in here. And for two, I need my dad to keep seeing me as some sad, friendless fuck. It keeps you guys safe. Association with Vi and Riorson is one thing, but the hatred he holds towards me right now might be even stronger than it is towards them."

"Are you saying you *aren't* a sad, friendless fuck?" she quips,

Dain only glares at her.

"I'm joking, I'm joking." she coughs as she laughs and then grabs her forehead, "Do you ever feel like this?"

"I've been getting 'magic sickness' since the day Cath bonded me, Sloane. Just not sure why you are too, now."

"Did I mess up your magic?" She whispers, looking down at her palms.

"No," Dain is quick to shift the blame, there's no way its her. It has to be him, 

"This happened a lot after Cath and I first bonded. In fact, my first year was a living nightmare after I started wielding."

"I guess we really don't know enough then." 

"We don't, and there's no point in stressing out over something you can't control yet."

Finally he retires from his desk chair, pushes it underneath the desk, and treks slowly to his bed where Sloane lies on her back on top of the sheets.

"What if I never manage to control it?"

He thinks for a few moments, gnawing on his bottom lip to find the right thing to say to ease her anxiety.

Then it comes, naturally, and more easily than turning her away from her fear.

"When I first discovered my signet I was horrified. I kept it a secret for months, until finally my father pulled me to the side and forced me to tell him. He's headstrong, so you wouldn't think it, but he's equally as observant."

Sloane's eyes are a deep blue in the mage light, deep, glistening quarries of aquamarine that reflect all the light that hits them as he rambles on,

"At first I thought he'd turn me in. I thought I was cursed. Honestly I wished Cath would've burned me alive instead of bonding me." Dain's eyes roam the expanse of the bed, of her body, her legs, the soft blonde hairs barely visible on them in mage light.

He continues, hyperaware of how his voice vibrates through the room, "Inntinnsics have a single fate and that is that all possible pathways lead to death unless they can be conveniently controlled. All things are possible with control. And, I learned to love the leash."

Sloane snorts softly. Probably agreeing in her own way.

"Basgiath convinced me I could be utilized like a weapon, and it helped me, *honed* me. Until... I made the mistake of trusting too much, and it costed your brother and Soleil their lives."

She doesn't respond, but that fury in her eyes ignites. Dain remembers his father telling him fires burn the hottest and the most devastating where they're blue, and there, standing over her laid across his bed, Sloane Mairi burns through him. Incandescent, furious, and more dangerous than anything he could imagine even in her most vulnerable state.

"Is that what I need to be? A weapon for someone?" she mutters, eyes on Dain, but not seeing him, not focused on him.

She's exhausted, no doubt.

He bends his leg, dropping a knee onto the mattress and finding himself ready to succumb to sleep. "No, Sloane," he assures her. "You could orchestrate the arsenal, decide who wields what and when. You can be a quartermaster of destruction, or the blade itself, you just need to choose."

"So I hide? Throw away lives while claiming mine matters more; true Navarrian to suggest that, aren't you?"

"A strategist is just as valuable as a soldier."

Sloane scoffs, her eyes water, tears stinging at the corners, blinking slowly, "And what would I use? If I wanted to conduct destruction, what weapon would you suggest?"

Easy, he thinks.

"Me."

Her head rolls again, facing him with porcelain features that don't change as fat tears roll over her nose and into the blankets.

"Use me.*"

She licks her lips and swallows heavily, sneering softly before closing her eyes, "Use the inntinnsic as a weapon. Not the wind wielder, or the fire fire wielder—the inntinnsic."

"I'm a fountain of powerful magic Sloane, you're a siphon, *use me.*"

Sloane rolls her eyes and groans, "Get in the bed Aetos."

"You're laying on the sheets."

"Then you should fix that."

Dain raises a brow, then grabs the sheets by her feet, yanking down. 

The fabric slides from beneath her, and his shirt, oversized on her frame, rides up with the motion. For a split second he catches a flash of pastel-blue fabric, high-cut with a small white bow at the front seam, before the shirt settles back down. Her eyes widen, realizing what just happened.

He clears his throat and quickly pulls the sheets up over her, then begins climbing in next to her,

"There. Fixed."

Pastel-blue. High-cut. A delicate white bow at the center.

Sloane is breathing deeply only minutes later, her legs splayed out like her arms,  but sleep doesn't find Dain the way he thought it would. Instead, blood finds his nether regions and keep him up while he tucks away his erection, hiding it under his palm underneath the waistband of his sleeping pants.

Time passes relentlessly and Cath comes alive in their bond at some point.

*"Do what you usually do."* his dragon advises—as if whipping out his dick and beating it with her sound asleep next to him was normal.

*"Are you insane? She's right next to me."*

Cath grunts.

*"Sounds like a you promblem; formation in four hours."*

*"Perfect. Four hours to contemplate what a shit advisor you are."*

Dain can practically taste Cath's smug satisfaction through the bond.

*"You're welcome."*

*"That wasn't a compliment."*

*"It very well should have been."* the swordtail hisses, reprimanding him with with a sharp tug, *"I've given you plenty of good advice. You just don't listen."*

Dain whines, nearly outloud, *"Name one time."*

*"I told you not to let her sleep in your bed."* 

Dain glances at Sloane, at the way her hair fans across his pillow, the gentle rise and fall of her breathing. *"She clearly needed—"*

*"And now you're suffering the consequences of you decision for the umpteenth time. See? Good advice. Ignored."*

*"She seemed like she needs someone. And she still does."*

Cath's tone softens, just slightly, *"You cannot fix her, Hatchling. You can barely fix yourself."*

*"I'm not trying to fix her."*

"Aren't you?"

"I'm not trying to fix her."
"Aren't you?"
The question hangs there, heavier than it should be. Dain shifts, tucking his arm under his pillow. "I just want her to know she's not alone."
"Then mission accomplished. Now go to sleep before you do something stupid."
"Like what?"
"Like wake her up with your incessant brooding."
Dain huffs, but Cath's presence settles into something steadier, quieter. The rhythm of their bond evens out, and despite himself, Dain feels his breathing slow to match it.
"Still here?" Cath asks, almost gently.
"Trying not to be."
"Good. Keep trying."
And somewhere between one breath and the next, sleep finally takes him.
