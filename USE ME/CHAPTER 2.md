### [Chapter 2](https://archiveofourown.org/works/63478354/chapters/165354304): Dain | Abnormalities

"I've been thinking," Sloane begins, sweaty after sparring with Matthias, "That you might only see me as a future liability."

She's gripping her sides pretty tightly. She'd been thrown by Imogen right onto her back and sent straight into grappling with the squad leader right after, at which point Matthias beat her until she couldn’t lift her arms.

Today's one of the last hotter days of the season; Dain can feel it in the way the winds blow more strongly, how the nights are cooler and the the mornings peak with faint warmth instead of a blistering flare. They hadn't spoke in two days, so Sloane initiating conversation was a revelation for him, 

"Are you still participating in that remedial training with Imogen?" he asks, arms crossed over his chest, 

"I am." she wipes her face off.

"Okay."

"If I agree to train my signet, will you stop being so fucking cryptic towards me?" she growls,

"Isn't he like that with everyone?" Lynx asks from behind them,

"Shut up—," Sloane grits out, "and go away!" she swats at him and he saunters off to Aaric and Baylor, "Will you?" she circles back and strains to straighten herself out,

"Sure." Dain agrees, anything to get her to train he'll do. "I'll tell you *some* things."

"Wait. Really?" her mouth falls open,

He turns to her "Why not? It's best to do it with me—after all, I have a bunch of magic I can't utilize for anything."

_"Your power is not for just anything. You lecture the woman to train hers yet you do not do the same with your own. Ignorance."_ 

Cath’s scolding hits sharp enough to make the insides of Dain’s ears itch.

"Next week," she pants, "Next week, let's start next week, and in Aretia too."

Dain smiles, "Next week, and imbuing too."

She grimaces, "Can you even do that?"

"Of course I can."

Of course—he'd give her what she wants, or at least it ends up that way.

---

They start late on a Wednesday evening, well before Sloane's "next week," but Dain is fine with it. Carr’s disapproval is palpable with her intentionally refusing to wield during his classes, but especially because he's pulled Dain to the side several times to bitch about it.

Sloane's signet makes his body feel like a block of ice rolling down the sandy dunes of a desert. He can't really describe the sensation, but it makes every damn inch of his skin tingle with heat as his insides freeze over. He worried about unwanted physical reactions due to the sensation combined with skin-ship previously.

She siphons Cath's magic from him bit by bit, until sweat beads at her hairline and his toes feel warm, but sting as if they've fallen asleep. She opens her eyes and grabs the dagger beside her. Dain uncrosses his legs and scoots towards her so that she's nestled in-between them. He looks up and realizes he's neglected to take note of their proximity when his lips nearly graze hers,

"How do you want me?" He mutters, reaching his arms out behind him and leaning back onto his palms to give her space.

"This is fine." She holds the dagger in one hand and places her other hand openly against his thigh, then she closes her eyes again, exhaling.

The sensation is completely different this time, and when Dain closes his eyes he can see the flow of his magic racing around the shape of his body and into the dagger. It files in through the leather handle and then rams to the tip of the blade, some catching against its shape, but most of it spilling away from the opaque outline.

"Can you... see that?" Dain asks her, opening one eye just a bit.

Her face scrunches, "See what?"

"The magic?"

He observes her with a quick glance. Sloane's eyes are like lakes hidden behind perfectly golden-yellow foliage, "Where are you seeing it? I mean, I can feel it..."

Dain closes his eyes and focuses. He can especially see the swirling iridescent movement of magic being pulled from the core of his body, through Sloane's hands and into the dagger. Its unmistakable, like when handling runes, he can see it as much as he can feel it leaving his body. He swears there are two colors underneath the initial oil slick of coloring, but he can't be sure.

"It's just here, in front of us..."

"Like runing magic?"

Suddenly, he feels the unpleasant shock of electricity through his thighs up into his chest. The sensation is so powerful that he groans and clutches the fabric of his uniform over his breast and chokes in a sharp gasp,

_"Gods, fuck!"_ he snarls, squinting his eyes,

Sloane panics in front of him, "Shit! I forgot to focus on the the quantity trying to see what you were seeing." She's rambling, not even looking at him,

"It's fine, it scared me more than anything." He sits up a bit and rubs the back of his neck, "You've been focusing on the quantity?"

She gives him a look he can't quite decipher.

"I..." she takes a deep breath, "I hate this power. I really do. But Thoirt is fond of me. At least it feels like she is, more than other riders and their dragons, and I don't want her to ever think my disfavor towards my ability is directed at her. So, I spent the last few days thinking about all there is to a siphoning signet. I went to the archives even, but there really wasn't much in specifics to it like there is with more common signets, you know, like wind, fire, and ice wielders. It's all just _give and take_. And imbuing."

Dain lets her finish, scared to disturb the progress she's letting him in on. He feels pride bubbling up in his chest for her and fights back a smile.

"I thought about the few times I've siphoned. Specifically from you and General Sorrengail."

"What'd you come up with?" he mumbles, looking away, he can tell they're both uncomfortable.

"For starters, I can control it when I want to, when and where, off and on." She lets go of his thigh and he immediately misses the heat of her hand, "Like a valve. But when I siphoned from General Sorrengail, it felt like she was pushing her power into me."

Dain looks at her face to cue her continuation.

"It was overwhelming, but then it happened with you too, with Mira. It's like you guys were willing the magic into me, faster and harder. And Brennan just absorbed it all so easily... The amount I give and take have to be in proper ratios, and it depends on the person too."

Her training continues like this. *Silent*. 

"Is there a reason why you like sleeping in here?" he blurts; the question leaves his lips as he generates it in his mind and he almost bites his tongue asking.

Sloane's eyes grow wide and she rips her hands away, "Do I need a reason?"

"...I would think so?" he responds,

"Well..." she closes her eyes and inhales deeply.

"We need to address what happened in Athebyne." he clears his throat, "Or at least I do."

Her brow furrows, "There's not much to talk about. You snitched, my brother died. I get it."

"I didn't mean—I told my father—I told General Aetos about Violet's memories, that I accidentally saw, because I wanted to prove she wasn't involved in whatever was going on at the time."

Finally her eyes snap open, and she fixes a disgusted leer on him,

"Why do you feel like you need to explain yourself to me right now? And after you let me blame Violet for *months.* She would never hurt me."

Dain looks away.

"I know," he stammers, "I know she wouldn't, I wouldn't hurt you either. I never mean for any of this to happen, I swear."

Sloane's signet stops abruptly and that same pain shocks through him, leaving him breathless and grasping at his chest.

"But it did, didn't it?"

He nods.

"I'm sorry."

"I know, and unfortunately you apologizing for the rest of your life will never make it forgivable."

---

Cath wakes up Dain at brink of dawn.

He grabs a piping hot carafe of coffee from commons and sets it on his desk before showering, brushing his teeth, and changing into his flight leathers. By the time he's done and rubbing his cologne on, the coffee is at a drinkable temperature. He pours himself a cup and begins to lace up his boots.

_"Morning Cath."_

_"Risen before the sun, Knight."_

Outside feels pleasant enough. He huddles in with the rest of leadership the dais, its takes all of fifteen minutes for the rest of quadrant to appear. Hordes of Cadets in rider black, quiet but complaining. Naturally, he glances back and over Flame Section to and sees Sawyer sleepily staring up at the sky. Roll is called and reported up the chain and then formation breaks.

Tactics, maneuvers, and physics pass peacefully.

During weapons training he tries his best to casually observe his sections and their respective squads, but he can't help noticing Sloane's flushed features and sloth movements. When she's called to the mat for her challenge his feet are moving faster than his brain,

"What's wrong?" he asks, grabbing her face with one hand, turning her head side-to-side, "Why are you sweating like that?" She feels damp, and the moisture that creates harsh highlights along the sweat that pools above her cupid’s bow.

"I don't know," she rasps, "Keep throwing up. And don't _ever_ touch my fucking face,"

His features screw up in confusion as she swats his hand away with a concerning lack of force.

"What?" Matthias shuffles next to him, "Sloane?"

"Why the fuck would you not say something?" Aaric growls at her, he's a mat over and has Lynx in a nasty headlock,

"I'll take her to the healers, hopefully its just a stomach bug."

He doesn't say anything when Matthias begins easing her body against Sloane's for support, but he feels her hand touch his fingertips so lightly that he wouldn't have noticed if it hadn't been for the dampness blanketing her skin,

"Your room, after brief." she croaks, its almost as unnoticeable as the touch.

By the time brief rolls around, Dain’s still chewing on what happened. The way she’d barely stood. The brush of her fingers and Matthias returns late, concerned.

"Aetos," she begins, shuffling through her squad to sit next to him, "They don't know what's wrong, Winfred sent for Nolon and he told me to come back to class."

Dain glowers, Nolon's a fucking rat, "Is it... a cold?"

Matthias is quiet, "I don't think so, Winfred said she had 'withdrawal-like' symptoms."

"I wonder if she pushed herself too far last night." He mutters aloud.

"Wait, is she actually training her signet?"

He looks up at Matthias and smiles, "Yeah, she is. And surprisingly she has been on her own too."

He pauses, and the thought creeps in uninvited—_he's_ been sick too. Not the fever kind, not something that came and went.

More like a constant hum under his skin. An ache, a weight. Since last year—since that interrogation chamber with Violet, since he stopped using his signet entirely.

He remembers the first time Cath truly _reamed_ into him about it—  
the kind of lashing only a creature of ancient intelligence could deliver without raising its voice.

_"You treat your power like it’s poison,"_ Cath had hissed as Dain sat alone in the flight field with him, _"hoard it like some cursed thing, waiting to be rid of. That’s not restraint. That’s cowardice."_

Dain had said nothing at the time—what could he say? That it _was_ poison? That every time he reached for it, it burned hotter, stretched further, echoed longer? That it didn’t feel like his anymore?

_"Magic must move, Knight,"_ Cath continued, slower now, crueler for the calm. _"It’s not meant to sit dormant. You dam it up long enough, and it turns back on you. Floods your system and rots it from within."_

At the time, Dain thought it was dramatics. Just more dragon-speak.  
But now—watching Sloane shiver and burn in the aftermath of a power she didn’t want—he wonders if Cath had been warning them *both*.

Matthias blooms in her seat, "That's great!" she grabs his shoulder, "And this is the most emotion you've shown since... Aretia."

"I've been sick too. I think." He admits, pushing back the thoughts of his... *rotted* magic.

"Well I would say maybe she caught it from you, but you guys are like never around each other... and withdrawal isn't a symptom of naturally occurring illnesses. Maybe it is the training? What did you guys even do?"

Wingleader in the making, he admires; her concern for her peers is valiant.

"We know she siphons my power well enough, so she tried to imbue it into one of her daggers." He answers, not missing a beat.

"Did it work?" Matthias inquires, curiosity brimming in her eyes,

He thinks about it for a second—how the blade had hummed in her grip, the edge catching light it hadn’t before.

_It felt different. Not alive, but not empty either._

“Kind of,” he admits. “It’s holding _something._ Just not sure what yet.”

"What are you guys talking about?" Imogen interrupts,

"Sloane," they both say,

'Is she feeling better?' Imogen asks, concern playing into her sharp features,

"I'm not sure, I'm going to check in on her after we get out of battle brief."

_"Was I sick?"_ He asks Cath; it seemed like the obvious reason for his relief. She siphoned whatever he had come down with.

_"I am not certain, but... Today you do seem less burdened."_

_"Can illnesses even be siphoned? Isn't siphoning just a means of conducting and transferring magic?"_

_"I would believe so."_ He hurr-umphs through the bond, _"The medicinal ones should be able to discern it."_

"Does she have the flu? In the start of the summer?" Sawyer wonders,

Ridoc laughs, "Yeah right now is awful timing, rotation is soon."

Dain frowns, "Hopefully she's feeling better by then."

"Gods know how upset she'll be if she doesn't get to go home this weekend." Imogen says, twirling her ink pen against her fingers.

"We'll have to carry her." Dain says, plainly, and all of their heads twist in his direction.

"Yeah dude, good luck convincing Cath, Aotrom already told me to get fucked."

"I think I'm asking for too much already," Sawyer mumbles, waving to his leg.

_"Would I be out of line asking this of you?"_

Cath's end of the bond is full of wonder.

_"It shall be done."_ he states simply,

Dain's eyebrows shoot up, "Cath says he's fine with it."

"Are you sure Cath is a Red?" Matthias gasps, she's giving Dain a long sideways glance,

"I feel like Cath is more chill than Tairn." Sawyer whispers.

_"Do not compare me to that brute or the savage he mates."_ Cath bellows.

Dain laughs, and they all look at him with raised brows.

---

_"Your favored one approaches, young Knight."_

Dain shoots up from his desk. He's been waiting for hours; it had gotten dark outside and he even bathed and retired his uniform.

_"I do not favor her."_

_"As I do not breathe fire."_

"Sloane," he says, opening the door before she can knock, he grabs her hand and lets her guide herself in,

"Hey," she still looks awful, eyes squinting at the mage lights,

"What's going on?" He wills the lights to dim, then looks over at Sloane, "Get on the bed."

She complies and flops down once she's on the bed. She's in her sparring uniform.

"You changed into that?"

"I was so sweaty I was smelling bad, I didn't want to come here and stink up the place." she flops a hand up, "Then I realized halfway here that I changed into this."

He gets up and grabs a shirt from his armoire. Its a soft cotton t-shirt that's been dyed a deep maroon.

"Want to wear this?" He asks her, offering it with an outstretched hand,

"Do you mind turning around?" she says, scooting to the edge of the bed.

He takes a seat at his desk, which faces the opposite wall.

"Nolon says my body is 'overrun' with magic and when I tried imbuing it I felt a bit better but nothing really changed. And the item wasn't even imbued."

"So it was me." Dain sighs, "I think maybe our power is too much for you to train with."

"But if that was the case why didn't this happen in Aretia?"

Dain thinks for a moment, listening to her clothing hit the bedroom floor.

"...maybe Brennan being there to receive the excess magic meant it carried straight through you to him, like a conduit."

"But Brennan wasn't sick at all when we went back to Riorson House."

That's true. But she also wasn't sick after she Siphoned Violet's mom and dragon, and that was considerably more power over a longer period of time. Right?

_"Is your power that strong?"_ He asks Cath through bond.

_"Our power is not like others, young Knight."_

_"What do you mean?"_

_"Magic processed through myself is not quite as it once was after I have harnessed it."_

_"Is it not magic anymore then, once you've... harnessed it?"_

_"It is as it should be."_

Dain shakes his head as Cath's presence retreats from their bond.

_What the fuck does that even mean?_

"I'm done." Sloane says.

She's folded her clothes neatly and set them on the nightstand, and now lays fully on her side, sprawled across his bed. The shirt is bunched up just below the curve of her ass, exposing her long, toned legs and he wishes for a split second that the bed was in the middle of the room so he could chance a peak by the armoire. Either way, he takes in the sight of her freckled clavicle just as graciously.

"I don't think our... magic... leaves your body if you aren't... pushing it into _someone_ else. Maybe we should ask Mira how she felt afterwards."

"But once I siphoned your magic, Brennan _used_ it to mend her. So it would've been his power harnessing yours... right? Do you think the properties of your magic remain the same when someone else utilizes it?"

"I have no idea..."

She raises an eyebrow at him, "I thought you knew a lot about siphoning? You walked me through it with Brennan."

Dain's eyes snap to hers. She's still very flushed, and looks significantly more tired than usual. Her current docile nature is unsettling.

"Well I just..."

The memories blast through his body like a crossbolt, and he shudders. He remembers the amount of time Naolin put into understanding his signet, the years of training, the dedication to keep Brennan safe. He could explain it to her because Naolin explained it to Brennan. But he can't make out the details he could then, now. He can't even recall them.

And he never touched Naolin, or Brennan.

He covers his mouth and leans down against the desk. Pushing the unnecessary thoughts away.

"Are you okay? You look... pale." Sloane asks, panic laced in her words,

He reaches down the bond and finds the garnet ramparts of Cath's shields neatly placed behind their battle flag.

"When I asked you if you could see the magic, you said you couldn't right?"

"Yeah."

"When you were siphoning our magic I could see two distinct flows: yours, and mine. They run like a circuit that encompasses our bodies, but wherever you're moving the magic to, it takes the shape of that object for a moment. But not entirely."

He sits at the desk and turns it's chair to face her.

"When you were siphoning us into your dagger, it was working but I could see where our magic was also being... pushed through the top of it. Like it was too much, or just spilling out I guess."

"It doesn't help that you can see it when its my ability."

Dain chuckles, "Right. I guess maybe we'll have to do some training with some controlled variables and take notes."

"Ugh." She whines, "I don't know, this feels like shit. And this still doesn't make sense. I can see magic when I shape runes. I'm Tyrrish, its second nature to me.."

He watches her eyes flicker around.

"I'll report your condition at formation tomorrow, but do you think you could drop in for Signet Sparring?"

"Can't we all just come here?"

"Absolutely not." Dain snaps, "For one, I make an exception every time I let you in here. And for two, I need my dad to keep seeing me as some sad, friendless fuck. It keeps you guys safe. Association with Vi and Riorson is one thing, but the hatred he holds towards me right now might be even stronger than it is towards them."

"Are you saying you _aren't_ a sad, friendless fuck?" she quips,

He glares at her.

"I'm joking, I'm joking." she coughs as she laughs and then grabs her forehead, "Do you ever feel like this?"

"Since you siphoned from me in Aretia I've been feeling feverish... Throwing up.... and I get light-headed a lot too."

"Did I mess up the magic?" She whispers, looking down at her palms.

"No," Dain is quick to shift the blame, there's no way its her. It has to be him, "This happened a lot after Cath and I first bonded. In fact, my fist year was a living nightmare after I started wielding."

"I guess we really don't know enough then."

Dain nods and lifts up her legs to pull the sheets from underneath her; it's almost too dark but he can see the blush spread across her face all the way to her ears when his shirt betrays her and billows up for a split second. He pretends he doesn't notice and gets in the bed next to her, she doesn't fit herself against him tonight and tosses and turns in her sleep.

But that's fine since he fights a raging erection thinking about her high cut, pastel-blue panties and the white bow adorned on front seam for hours, before finally succumbing to sleep.
