 Faint shuffling and grunts pull Sloane out of subconsciousness and into reality.

It wasn’t unusual for her to sleep half aware of her surroundings. That had started after bonding with Thoirt, and she assumed it was her dragon’s way of keeping her safe even at her most vulnerable. Seconds pass like millennia as her mind stirs awake, reaching quickly for what’s missing.

She remembers her date with Dain, shopping, eating, their night together. His eyes against amber mage lights as he admired the ink pen she spent hours shopping for. How she fell asleep in his arms, careful to keep his stitched front just far enough to avoid accidents.

He might've rolled to the other side of the bed is what she thinks when she doesn't feel the radiating heat from his body on hers, and she shimmies backwards expecting to feel his broad chest.

But there's *nothing.*

Sloane’s eyes snap open as she flips onto her other side, heart hammering. The expanse of mattress is empty, his pillows cool beneath her hand. There's only the ghost of his scent, fading fast. Sloane's chest expands and contracts in preparation for the unavoidable cut-off of air as panic suffocates her and her senses.

He's not here.

He said he'd be here.

Through the double doors to his terrace the sun rises, painting the cliffside in molten orange and bruised violet. It should be breathtaking, but anxiety makes the colors smear uselessly in her vision, beauty wasted against the choke of dread.

Her mind knots fast, tangling memory and fear until it sticks together like a spider's web, impossible to separate. 

What if Melgren came to apprehend him? 

What if Cath decided Dain would be better off around the Empyrean only?

What if he was being made to pay the consequences of Cath's actions back in the Citadel? 

Each possibility stacks over the last, louder and heavier until her chest is too tight to hold a breath. The weight of her dread pins her to the bed, eyes fixing on the curtain that separates his bedroom from his workspace like it might burst open with infantry, healers, and unknown riders. It doesn’t matter that logic tells her he’s likely near; panic has already convinced her she’s been left, that he’s gone, and the room tilts with the thought.

"Sloane?"

Her head whips toward Dain's voice, the crack of motion almost painful. He stands half dressed, watching her with a crease of concern. Relief crashes over her so abruptly it bursts out as a shaky laugh. 

His baritone sinks into her bones, stroking away the gooseflesh and dragging calm through the knots in her shoulders until she’s left trembling with release.

_"I thought—"_ she gasps, palm flattening to her chest before she can stop it, eyes catching on the breadth of his. "You’re *here*."

Dain looks puzzled still, but he answers nonetheless,

"Not for much longer. Ad hoc meeting regarding Squadron Zero's flight plan for the northern expedition."

She doesn't respond; she's still dazed from the onslaught of self-induced panic.

"Want to get breakfast together?" he rasps, voice tolled by sleep, heavy with disuse.

Sloane nods erratically, "Yes," she breathes, "I would like that."

Dain turns away from her to finish dressing in garbs similar to yesterday. He's covered in all black and instead of his jerkin he wears a thick, forest green cloak with a collar that extends over his shoulders and clavicle, adorned in some kind of illustrious black fur.

He gives her a quizzical glance before yanking back the partitioning curtain and Sloane offers up a smile that feels more like a grimace hoping it'll quench whatever thoughts were making him give her a look like the one she'd just received.

*"Worried so early in the morning, Love?"*

Thoirt's chiming voice combs through Sloane's nerves soothing her rigid edges,

*"Never done that before."* Sloane admits, blinking after Dain who's busy fitting parchment, missives, and his own notes into a canvas sleeve, *"And hopefully I'll never do it again."*

*"You toil for your mate, of course it's only natural."*

Sloane scoffs and Dain peeks back at her, only stopping his movements for a second before moving to the seating area where a pair of polished leather boots are pulled onto his feet,

*"He's not my mate."*

Her answer is quick, a knee-jerk reaction to Thoirt’s usual teasing, but the daggertail’s poking commentary leaves room for much desired. 

After all of *this,* the date, the sex, these feelings, this tension between them, what are they really?

Just yesterday he'd said establishing a friendship, but this already felt so much more than that to Sloane; friendships didn't leave her awake at night wondering what a person might like as a gift, foods they'd want to have homemade, how their skin felt in the sunlight.

Her thoughts fracture when Dain's hand cups her jaw, warm and strong, inescapable all at once. The faint scrape of his calluses feels achingly real, his thumb steady beneath her chin and commanding her gaze. Her breath catches—not from fear this time, but from how much she has subconsciously needed this steadiness from him

The spiral collapses into nothing but the weight of his touch and the focus in his gaze. For a second she can’t tell which of them is trembling harder. She can't possibly figure out why *he's* nervous at the same time as her.

He studies her like this moment matters more than he'd openly admit, it's something new and exposed in him for her; an expression she hasn't seen before,

"Tell me what’s wrong," he murmurs at last, voice low, "Don’t hide from me. I won’t hide from you."

Sloane glances down at nothing, grimacing inwardly. The realization that him not being there for all of the *five seconds* of her being awake had sent her into the depths of her own despair.

She lets the weight of her head sink into Dain's palm and schools her breathing before finally speaking after considering his inquiry.

He seems like he's asking for the things she knows he's been depraved of: trust, transparency, honesty. All the things that had been compromised for her as well.

"No shadows?" she whispers to him after meeting his eyes,

"Shadows?" 

Dain looks confused again and the scrunch of his forehead intensifies.

"It's what we say to each other before we admit a truth we'd otherwise guard."

"You and who?" his eyes narrow with suspicion, or perhaps *jealousy?* 

"My year mates."

His espresso irises wander about her face then he sits at the edge of the mattress, looming, "Okay: no shadows."

Sloane inhales, sucking down enough air that she shakes softly as her lungs bottom out.

"Are you sure?" she prods.

Dain's hand falls from her face and he kisses her, long, slow, *hot,* 

"Yes. Absolutely" he grumbles, "Teach me how to understand you. Everything you need from me to feel loved properly Sloane, show me how. Use me." 

She sighs. There he goes again, telling her to use him.

"I'm scared for you." her eyes drop once more and Sloane discovers it's hard to look him in the face while admitting a weakness, "I woke up and you weren't there, and I assumed all of the worst things I could think of."

"So that was panic just now? You... jerking around as you waking up?"

She nods and rolls her eyes knowing that he'd just had a noble's seat at the *wake up and immediately spazz* show. She imagines how it might've looked to him.

Probably like a freshly dewatered fish, flopping around pointlessly, mouth agape, eyes strained. *Stupid.*

Sloane feels her cheeks heat; maybe she could pass it for interpretive dance? Upon calculation of his unwavering stare she realizes, *probably not,* and Dain doesn't seem amused. He seems... worried?
 
"I think you might've just experienced what I did when I went looking for you in the archives." his voice is a breathless groan, then to himself he huffs, 

"We should both work on overcoming impulse under pressure."

Sloane crawls beside him, legs dangling off the bed and brushing against his. A shocked laugh bursts out of her when he tugs her into his lap, her thighs flush to his, his chest is a  firm wall at her back. Dain's arm hooks over her middle while his chin drops heavy to her crown. The warmth of him seeps into every cold place left by the empty bed, and her pulse stutters at how right—how dangerous—it feels to belong here.

"I haven't seen you act impulsively." her brows pinch together in disbelief.

She feels his jaw go taut against her skull, "It's gotten better for me."

"When have you *ever* been impulsive?"

He exhales before he speaks and fiddles with her hair, "Decapitating Kubic..."

Sloane's head tilts as she waits for him to finish his testimony; Kubic's decapitation had been earned on his own behalf, and Dain had looked *terrific* as the rider's executioner. They likely had contrasting opinions about it though, so Sloane keeps her lusty comments to herself.

"...Everything regarding Violet. Trusting my father. Not trusting Riorson." 

Sloane enjoys the rumble of nervous laughter that echoes through his chest against her back.

Would telling him seeing her wingleader end a life pointblank and in front of their professor with nothing more than a singular sentence to explain himself be crass? Sloane licks her lips, probably is her conclusion, and she opts to say nothing about it instead.

"Lots of things. You just haven't been around to see it for yourself."

"Even if you say that, you're still extremely reliable." She reaches for something she thinks might make him feel better about himself, 

"That's why Violet keeps you close, isn't it?"

*Has to be,* she thinks, because the "best friend" atmosphere did not exist between the two of them.

Dain shrugs, "Who knows? Go shower; I got some clothes for you from your room, they're in the bathing chamber."

"You don't want to shower *with* me?" she croons, wiggling against his lap.

He grabs her chin again, bending her neck upwards and kissing her painfully slowly the way he likes it, "You need a break after last night, and," he rubs his thumb against the sides of her throat, "please wear the mock neck uniform shirt I left out; the rest of your wing has arrived. They've been asking for you."

"How are you going to tell me that I need a break—,"

Sloane hops out of Dain's lap, fully prepared to spin around and argue with him but as her feet hit the floor she sways hard to the left. Dain reaches out, catching her at the waist as her knees buckle uselessly beneath her. 

He turns his face up to her, still seated, unimpressed and equally as smug. His smirk reveals a sharp canine and she digs her nails into the palms of her hands to stop herself from grabbing his face and kissing him.

*Unnecessarily handsome fucker.* 

"I just woke up, this explains nothing—"

"—if I get in that shower with you, you're getting it from behind with your feet and palms flat on the chamber floor, Sloane Mairi." He doesn't blink as he pulls her in close, "So unless you have some half-baked excuse as to why you're on limited duty status afterwards, I'd suggest taking the out that I'm *allowing* you to have."

She pictures it, *feels it* even. Just how far could he reach from that angle?

"Is that supposed to be a threat?" she bites, glaring, *not* imagining him fucking her against the tiled walls, digging his fingers into her hips while holding the back of her neck while he relentlessly plunders her.

Dain's hand drops from her waist and grips her ass cheek, his long fingers brush against her entrance. 

"Feels like you want to find out," 

Sloane takes a step back; they both recognize her silent surrender.

She swallows, willing her pulse back under control, while Dain stands and adjusts the clasp of his cloak like nothing at all had just passed between them. The wingleader again. The Flightleader now.

"I'll make use of your mouth and rearrange that attitude later, don't worry." he says over his shoulder as he opens the suite door, 

"Meet you in the dining hall."

---

Breakfast is nice enough, savory, buttery, even sweet except when Dain asks the kitchen staff for dried flameshaft pepper flakes then sprinkles them across his eggs and looks confused when she lifts a brow as he devours it all,

"Flavor." he says, very unconvincingly, "Try it."

Sloane pulls away when he attempts to hand the small glass vial to her, "No, it's too early to have heartburn."

She wonders for a moment if she might've noticed this before had she paid attention to him the few times they'd been near each other in the dining hall together. 

"You're too young to be experiencing heartburn."

"Hypothetically, the odds are it happens before it doesn't though."

Dain rolls his eyes, "How pessimistic of you."

"Does Cath like his sheep spicy?" she chides sarcastically, poking at his bond as if the swordtail would share the same palette considering their attachment to each other.

The brunette halts at her question, cutting his eyes towards the ceiling before refocusing on Sloane, "Pretty sure Cath likes fish when he can have it, but he settles for cattle usually."

Sloane's head drops to the side.

A single fish in her dragon's mouth wouldn't do anything to satiate her, let alone provide sustenance.

And a school of fish?

Diet and behaviors of dragonkind had been a topic rushed until just before threshing with Professor Kaori, and all of it had been a blur meant to remember for the sake of survival and not an otherwise informative agenda. Cath liking fish meant he, specifically, might even have skill set other dragons lacked entirely. Sloane considers the possibilities unknown to her and likely, all other riders—except Dain.

She slams her fork down onto the table, "I have questions."

Dain only chuckles, "I have answers."

"Your dragon," she begins, "likes *fish.*"

Dain nods.

"Which means he frequents bodies of water."

"Correct." he shovels another mouthful of sun-hot seasoned eggs, "He does."

Their eyes meet.

"Cath can swim?"

"*Hah!*" Dain's barking laugh echoes through the dining hall and he points his fork at Sloane, "No."

"Then how exactly is he eating fish?"

"Through joint effort."

Sloane taps their table, "Who's? The other Reds?"

"Mine."

She gawks at Dain.

The sheer amount of fish that it would take to amount to one adequately sized *cow,* likely a prized bull, for Cath would take at least a whole two to three days for a singular person to collect. She considers the fishing villages, and even for them it would be at least a whole trip's worth of earnings. For the larger fish they required a proper voyage to depths that crews didn't return from for days. Sloane's sure Dain doesn't own a fishing net, and as she nears the edge of disbelief she remembers—

"Do you fly over the sea with your dragon to catch fish?"

She watches as his face splits into a dizzyingly gleeful grin, one she hadn't seen before, one she couldn't have pictured until *now*. Sloane traces over his smile lines, the crinkles in the corners of his eyes, the way his ears lift with the pull of his cheeks, the faint blush blooming across them,

"Want to come with us when we can fly again?" he offers the experience to her plainly, as if he'd invited her to take a walk through Aretia, like it's a suggestion to go on another date, and, well;

"Think of it as another date. I'll catch and cook for you and Thoirt." 

He turns it into one.

"I'd... *love* that." she chirps, grinning right back at him, "Especially since I can't really imagine how this works. There are zero recorded evidences that dragons eat *fish.*"

Beneath the table the tip of his boot grazes up her ankle as she remarks the amount of endurance Cath must have to spend it hovering over the open ocean or whatever the two of them had to do to catch cow-sized fish,

"I'll show you everything I know, just ask." He taps his plate with the edge of his fork, "And Cath won't mind either, if Thoirt's joining us."

Sloane feels her heart lurch at their immediate thoughts of inclusivity towards her and she marvels in the feeling, wondering how to label it internally. She always feels seen, practically obsessed over by him, even when their feelings had been terribly misaligned,

"Thank you."

Dain grunts before smothering a smile that had yet to grace his features, he jerks his head at something behind her while he speaks, "Don't thank me for things you deserve, Sloane. Your *wingleader* is inbound—"

"Sloane Mairi, on your feet!"

Sloane scrambles out of her chair, boots dragging and her heels snapping together to assume proper posture as Rhiannon's voice fans over the patrons in the dining hall; her mouth drops open as a hoard of boots click over in their direction. The jump to attention is muscle memory at the sound of Rhi's booming voice and Sloane glances over at Dain who shrugs—hadn't he said *wingleader?*

"You left graduation during the reception without a hint or a warning; do you know I was questioned by not only King Tauri but General Melgren about your whereabouts during assignments?"

"You're my wingleader?!" Sloane manages to yelp stupidly while staff-straight, her eyes drag down to the wingleader patch sown across Rhiannon's shoulder in the same place Dain's was and the flame section one directly beneath it.

This *is* her wingleader.

Rhiannon ignores her, and with her face just a foot away from Sloane's with trembling eyes her voice raises again, "How the hell am I supposed to take accountability for my wing when I don't know where the fuck my riders are? You didn't have Thoirt tell anyone anything, and you just bounced on out of there like you don't have anyone to answer to."

In the corner of her eye, Dain leans back in his seat, jaw moving slowly as he chews the remnants of his breakfast.

"My apologies, Ma'am."

Her eyes narrow, "The valley, now, hatching grounds perimeter and back to the fortress; double time, until you're *wet.* Get there! And, I expect an explanation not an excuse."

Dain's brows lift with the corner of his mouth and Rhiannon turns to greet him, eyes glazed with overflowing emotions before she can even speak,

"I apologize for the disturbance, Sir. But it's *so* great to see you out and about again."

"Never thought I'd hear that from you." Dain laughs, smiling, "Congratulations on the promotion, Rhiannon. I only saw it coming from miles away."

"Apparently you and everyone else." Rhiannon harks,

"I'm her executive officer," Sawyer adds, settling at Rhi's side and pridefully beaming, "and no longer a single man."

Dain's smile stretches wider, "Oh?"

Sawyer’s mouth tilts. “Funny—feels like I’m not the only one off the market. Word is, the archives caught you… *busy.*”

Dain actually coughs and it's an abrupt, graceless bark that turns heads closest to their table. His hand stays over his mouth a beat too long and he rubs at his beard to play off the motion,

“I… don’t recall?” he rakes out hotly, though his words pitch a level higher than usual, nearly betraying him.

"Ohhhh—" Ridoc trudges between Rhiannon and Sawyer, "Don't make us bring Jessinia down here and—"

Sawyer hooks two fingers in Ridoc’s collar and yanks him back, hissing, “No, no—she told me in confidence, and she won’t tell me _who_ if I can’t even keep my mouth shut that she told me.” 

He slaps Ridoc’s chest like a silent _drop it_.

“That’s lame,” Ridoc mutters, unrepentant. “You _know_ he won’t tell, so we’ll never—”

"Don't be so confidently nosey, idiot." Rhi groans.

“He could,” Sawyer says, which is ridiculous, and they all know it.

"He won't." Dain adds, face unreadable.

He risks a glance at Sloane, a singular clean cut of his russet eyes meet hers with an unfortunate spark that causes her heart rate to soar. He looks away so fast it's nearly comical enough for her to laugh out loud, and she nearly does,

*"Looking at the Flightleader with that heat on your face would be a mistake, Love."*

Sloane takes the hint and keeps her head facing the same direction as her shoulders.

Dain clears his throat and pushes up from the table, brushing a hand down his blouse and pulling his cloak from around the back of his chair, “As entertaining as this is, I’ve got a meeting that won’t wait.” 

He lifts his cup, realizes it’s empty, and sets it down with casual precision.

“Don’t let her off easy, Rhi.”

He tips his chin at Sloane—just enough to make her stomach flip—before turning on his heel and striding for the exit.

“Speaking of not letting off easy,” Rhiannon pivots back to Sloane, voice sharp again. “You heard your orders. Move. Now.”

Sloane feels everything at once: the sting of pepper still on the air and burning her eyes, the fork she’d slammed glinting at the edge of her vision, the memory of his mouth on hers in a quiet aisle that smelled like paper and cold stone. 

It hadn’t been careful, or wise. It had been _him_—the way he’d taken her mouth desperately, the way the shelf creaked when her back found it, the way he had pulled away first like restraint could make the wanting he'd showcased gentler. 

The room hums and her pulse drowns it out.

The story the discovery of herself here with him will tell if anyone cares to listen: she vanished without notice, and dawn finds her at Dain’s table. To anyone else she loathes him, disrespects him even. Liam’s grave sits between their names; Violet’s anger once linked loudly to it; everyone is aware of the wound inflicted there, whether he meant it or not, even if they don’t know every reason that createed it.

Put those pieces together and the sight of them together looks wrong.

_“Head up,”_ Thoirt murmurs. _“Let them think what they want.”_

They’ll say she’s naive, or he’s manipulative, or that grief made her weak. They’ll make it a betrayal of the dead or of the living or both. None of those versions include Dain's quiet dedication to her in training and courting, in his sacrificing the little bit of free time he'd ever had for her, how he'd saved her life by killing Kavanaugh, who assumed the worst of her because of him

Discovery is a matter of time; but Sloane wonders, *who* and *why* should she be smothering her affections?

---

"Physical limitation is the gateway to emotional wreckage on the battlefield."

Dain had said that to her and the other first years just before gauntlet; thinking back to then, his demeanor was different; he was sharp-eyed and critical. More presently, and even before his father's assault, he remained more silently observant. That edge he had that kept him having the first word, and always commanding to have the last, had rounded entirely.

Physical limitation for Sloane begins in her chest with the irregular burning in both of her lungs as she climbs the valley, then in her knees as they bend and extend on the decline. In her shins and their pulling as her feet lift off the grassy floor and hyper awareness of how heavy they are begins to crowd her thoughts.

It's been hours, or at least it feels like it has been as another wave of exhaustion causes her to dry heave when her body finally surrenders. Overhead Thoirt circles, and Sloane glances upwards, drenched in both sweat and indignation,

*"How's the weather up there?"* she wheezes, gagging at the peak of the rolling hills she's been ordered to trek over.

Thoirt twists parallel to her while airborne, casting a massive shadow in the shape of her body that allows Sloane to peer up without being blinded by the sun, *"It's quite alright,"* she preens,  *"We have committed a great treason to your newly appointed leadership, have we?"*

*"I understand why it's an issue. I should have at least told her where I was headed."*

*"No matter. My rider does not look to escape the consequences of her actions. In my  fine opinion you have reflected appropriately."*

Sloane snickers, *"Have you?"*

*"The day I report to a human exists in neither this lifetime or the next."*

Sloane smirks, she attempts to stand shortly after but her legs won't cooperate. She's left squatting in the grass as Rhiannon descends the hillside towards her. The second-year knows she's expected to explain herself immediately after her corrective action, and she struggles to iron her feelings of desperation into a palatable excuse while forcing her knees to lock while she pushes up from her squatted position.

"Ma'am," Sloane begins when Rhi arrives just ahead of her, "I was just worried that Dain—"

The version of Rhiannon's voice that crashes over Sloane's is so subdued and forgiving her eyes widen,

"Sloane, you're all that we have left of Liam, and we promised to make sure you make it through all of this. I'm not trying to coddle you or control you, but the soft spot that you know we carry for you can't be abused because of that."

"Rhi I promise you I wasn't trying to—"

"Let me *finish,*" Rhiannon shouts.

She wants so badly to explain her actions but her wingleader is having none of it; in hindsight, not finishing her train of thought might be best for both of them. Saying too much of the truth only clarifies her intention, which had been Dain.

Who had been recently caught in cold-blood, busy, in the archives.

Sawyer and Ridoc might not have the coin to rub together for a inferential thought, but Rhiannon most certainly did.

The blonde shrinks down, dropping her head to avoid the fierceness in her leadership's eyes.

"I'm questioning *why* you left, it's *how* you left. There are guidelines and procedures in place for a reason. I'm responsible for you, in regards to my rank, and in memory of your brother. I was crushed when I went to muster the wing and couldn't find you. I panicked Sloane."

Sloane pulls Rhiannon into a sweaty embrace and her senior returns it without a second thought, "I'm sorry."

"Don't do that to me ever again, please. You and Aaric are fourth wing's best up and coming riders." she pulls her braids into a tighter ponytail, "And what's the point in you being squad leader if you aren't there to lead?"

*Squad leader?*

Sloane mouth hangs open uselessly, "I'm sorry?"

"Fourth Wing, Flame Section, Second Squad; Squad Leader, Cadet Sloane Mairi. Aaric might have an edge in combat but not only are you getting there, you've displayed leadership qualities that he lacks. And thanks to Dain's tutoring and testimony of your signet, apparently you're quite the well-rounded package."

*"Me?"*

"Yes Sloane, *you.*" Rhiannon belts out a wide-grinned, hearty laugh that makes her shoulders shake, "You should tell him once he's out of his meeting; we've decided anything besides what happened to him would be good to talk about."

Squad leader.

*"As expected."* Thoirt coos, landing close enough to awaken the earth around them haphazardly, then leaning over them both to blink down at Sloane, 

*"It is within your bloodline to simply be better."*

*"I wasn't expecting this."* she reaches upward towards Thoirt, grabbing for red scales,

*"Why? All the scaleless ones who joined you during Threshing follow you openly and proudly; they await your orders and seek your advice. They expect from you."*

Thoirt dips her nose down and passes feelings mixed with pride and glory through the hallways of their bond, smothering Sloane with congratulatory ebbs and prods. Rhiannon backs away to her Green to give the proper berth Thoirt requires.

*"How exciting this must be for you; you should tell Cath and the Flightleader."*

Sloane's brow pinches, *"Why would I tell Cath?"*

"*His rider has invested more in you than himself as of late, or so he'd complained of previously. Naturally, I fail to see an issue.*"

She pauses at that.

It probably would be a thoughtful... *trivial* nicety of her to report the fruit of Dain's efforts to Cath. She's certain the confidence that she'd regained this year was due to his pestering and training, his thoughtfulness and selflessness.

Though Cath terrified her, absolutely put the fear of Amari directly into her heart without much effort; how Dain was so painfully informal with his swordtail was beyond her.

"Go wash up, Mairi." Rhiannon calls from below, headed back towards Riorson House, Violet told me that meeting was going to take a while, so you've got the time to clean up before telling her and Dain!"

Her skin pebbles at the thought of how he’ll take her promotion. A hatching-grounds breeze slips over her, scented with winter fir and sage, a smell that conjures him even when he’s nowhere near.

Sloane imagines the brunette smiling wide, arms open to embrace her, his sienna eyes sliding shut while kissing her—the drop in his voice when he would lean close to whisper *congratulations* in her ear. She can almost feel his freshly washed hair, brushed and styled neatly for the Assembly, raking through her fingers. She shivers at the remembered width of his shoulders, the easy way his body engulfs hers.

What words would lance through her heart to make her bleed for him more?

She smooths her hands along Thoirt’s jaw until the burn in her muscles fades to a hum.

_“Rest first,”_ she suggests.

Sloane mounts in just a few practiced motions, and they lift, valley dropping away as they angle for the fortress.

"*Just so you know, my tiny terror, you are valued no less than if you had not received this honor.*" Thoirt assures her as they lace through towering clouds,

"*You deserve and outstanding rider, Thoirt. Sorry It took me so long to realize that.*" Sloane giggles, rubbing her hands at the base of her daggertail's neck.

"*Oh, hush. But I'm glad you've come to your senses. I wasn't sure how to encourage you.*"

Sloane shakes her head and repositions her flight goggles, *"You just staying beside me, especially at my worst, speaks louder than anything you could've told me."*

As Thoirt begins to speak, a shadow devours the sunlight around them, and she falls silent, banking so hard to the left that Sloane flattens herself in the saddle. Her Red tucks into a roll that would've scared her shitless had this been the first time, but thankfully it's not, and Sloane knows exactly why Thoirt's begun such an erratic flight as another dragon flanks them.

*Cath.*

The two reds braid around each other at blinding speeds, knitted so tightly Sloane could reach out and run her hands along his darker scales. The weave collapses into near-collision, Cath rolling so close she feels his heat scrape across her cheeks. His jaw parts just enough to exhale a rush of air that fogs her flight goggles.

This interaction feels precisely the same as when Dain had attempted to stop her from delivering Aaric's package to Violet.

Each time Cath knifes past, the air snaps her against the seat, goggles rattling against her face. Her stomach lurches with the shifts—half awe, half nerves—as if Cath is reminding her that Thoirt may carry her, but he could erase her with or without her bond present. He could pivot just right and bite her clean off Thoirt's scales without touching a single one.

*"Tell him."* Thoirt commands as Cath levels out just beneath her right wing, the close proximity forcing them both to glide.

Cath tilts, his enormous body banking upward until the world at Sloane's right narrows to the void of his eye. It eclipses everything in that direction until there is only her reflection trembling in his golden sclera. Thoirt holds steady, but Sloane’s breath stops; she's pinned, swallowed whole by the gaze of the most merciless dragon on the continent.

Sloane forces herself to acknowledge him, eyes sinking into that fathomless marigold that Dain is so fond of, admiring the way it’s weft against the rest of his eye roughly. It seems as though it were moving, breathing in an interlocked pattern with flecks of varying shades glittering against it.

Through the immense pressure of fear, Sloane manages to find a sort of comfort here.

_“Tell him, Love.”_ Thoirt instructs again, firmer.

Sloane forces air into her lungs.

“I’ve been promoted, squad leader.” she practically whispers to the dark slit of his pupil.

Cath compresses, his spine pinches tight and then unravels, he lurches forward in a motion that makes absolutely no sense in their glide. She blinks and suddenly he's ahead of Thoirt, then he stretches his wings outwards like the _lunatic_ of a creature that he is.

Dragons never extended their wings that fully at these speeds because they'd snap clean at the joints.

The motion forces Thoirt to do the same, and Sloane is launched forward and nearly out of the seat. Her own dragon bellows as they float backwards and then _downwards,_ caught in the draft of Cath’s spread.

Cath tucks his wings flat against his body, breaking through the air like a crossbolt and slamming his talons into Thoirt’s, who mirrors his fall. A scream builds in her chest as she remembers Dòrainn and Cath dragging General Aetos's dragon into the ground in the same action, but her voice is drowned out by Thoirt's.

Unlike her own scream, Thoirt's bellow bears no fear, only exhilaration, a war cry torn straight from her chest. Cath answers with a sound that splits the air like thunder and claps against her body in a violent folding of wind. His roar echoes through the skies, reverbrates within her ribs, booming in each wave until fading in a chronicle of wonderous clicking. Together they drive downward, the rotating drop so reckless Sloane swears the valley itself rises to meet them.

Sloane’s ears ring. Her body thrums. She clings to Thoirt’s neck as the daggertail releases Cath, both dragons unfurling at the last instant possible before they impact hard enough into the grassy plains. The earth buckles beneath the force of their descent, a crater ripping open and flinging soil and stone in a rain of debris.

For a moment she thinks the crash will last forever, then the rumbling dies, leaving only eerie silence. The hush stretches long enough to make her skin crawl, as if the earth itself is stunned by what just tore into it.

Sloane feels Thoirt's magic snake away from her body; she hadn't noticed the Red had even cast it to keep her in place. The blonde lifts her head shakily to find Cath staring down at her, pressed into the seat and shivering. In the moments she spent recovering from the rattling landing, Cath had already moved outside the crater,

*"Go to him."* Thoirt presses, stilling so Sloane can climb down the exapnse of her body,

*"Then what?"* Sloane pants, choosing her footing carefully while hiking out of the crater to where Cath stands.

*"Speak with him."*

Sloane scoffs, *"He can't speak back to me."*

*"I'm glad you know that."* Thoirt retorts, unimpressed at the blonde's culmination. 

Minutes later Sloane is once again sweaty and winded, and Cath steps forward, deigning to met her at the middle of their path towards each other. Dain's Red drops his head quick and low, stopping so abruptly before her that she nearly takes a step back.

She admires Cath the same way she does Dain; sapphire irises skating over his garnet scales, his broad frame, the studious cast of his features. Where Sliseag, Thoirt, and Dòrainn blazed in lively reds, Cath’s coloration was darker—a velvet crimson, almost shadowed. Like Dain himself, his skin a tone or two deeper than most, they were each their own distinct version of the same shade.

His horns are unique, much like Violet's Irid, Andarna, who's horns soar straight towards the skies like twisted temples. Unlike the other dragons who attained at least four, curved upwards from the temples and outwards behind their jaws, Cath's crowned horns began a sunken arc at first rise, then rounding outwards and flicking inwards. 

Sloane's mouth parts fractionally realizing Cath's primary horns vaguely make a heart shape.

Their eyes meet as hers drag across his snout, counting the thick spires that charge out between and around his eyes and jaw, and the larger, tertiary set of horns immediately jutting out where these scaled beasts ears are known to be.

"I'm a squad leader now, Cath." Sloane mutters to him, enraptured by chasmic marigold, "Can you believe that?"

He can't answer, of course, but she imagines what he might say in her head, she creates his voice as a variation of Dain's. Cath would sound infinitely gentle, preternaturally uncaring, with a cavernous burnished tone. His mannerisms would be sardonic and pointed, not willing to joke but always ready to insult.

Somehow he's almost a male version of how she imagined Sgaeyl and her thoughts fester with the comparison. Cath jerks his head upwards and Sloane jolts upright, startled clear off the valley floor as he puffs a hot shot of breath so strong it forces her backwards and into the crater.

She grasps at nothing as her body bounces backwards over the upturned ground, tumbling violently before she slams into Thoirt's talons, but the second-year doesn't miss a beat. She's on her feet, pointing up at the swordtail, hair full of dirt and debris,

"What in Malek's name was that for Cath?!" She smirks at herself. Talking to Cath—*madness.* Even if he could he wouldn’t waste breath on her. Of course not.

But that still doesn't mean he can go blasting her across valleys and into craters.

*"How brave."* Thoirt goads, unable to resist instigating as per usual.

Cath lifts his head enough to turn up his jaw without it scraping across the valley, and Sloane watches as his pupils dilate so thin she can hardly find them in the blaze of marigold they sit framed against.

*"For the ever impressive, sheer volume of audacity you manage to harbor within such limited proportions."* 

Sloane stops.

Her whole world stops.

Because that voice—impressively masculine, smoked, and effortlessly proper—*that* voice wasn't Thoirt's smoothed treble at all.

It's *Cath's.*
