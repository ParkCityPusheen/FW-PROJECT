Dain arrives with an apology ready at the parting of his lips, and as Sloane blinks away the sleep that had overtaken her anxiety while waiting, her eyes start at his boots and work their way up to his hair. 

Gods, was she grinning? She shouldn’t be grinning. But her cheeks are already warm, and she suddenly doesn’t know what to do with her arms.

As the door swings fully open, the freshly showered scent of him smacks her in the face and swells through her sinuses. He smells like winter firs and dried coltsfoot, with sage and salt beneath the aftershave she recognizes.

It isn’t sharp, not like most men’s colognes that slice through the air trying to prove something. This wraps around her slow, like heat off a brazier.

It’s uniquely _him._

She hears Dain talking—

"I got caught up with the assembly on the way back, and I can’t just walk away from my superiors. I'm sorry I'm so late,"

—but for fuck’s sake, the way he looks is so much louder than his worried apology. He’s in an expertly layered outfit: a blouse, a jerkin, a belt with a sheathed seax, pants, and riding boots.

That’s how she would’ve described his otherworldly appearance—if she weren’t absolutely drooling over seeing Dain in two outfits, outside of the rider black they wear, in a *single* day.

His jerkin is brown leather, loved and worn, definitely a hand-me-down from someone with an identical build. The shoulders flare out a few inches before curving upwards. In typical Tyrrish, fashion the jerkin splits a quarter ways down at the hem and bares four buckles, all trailing down the far right side of his chest and sown equidistant of each other staring at the collar. It's a longer vest, and ends just past his hips.

Beneath it he dons another high collared ivory blouse, but this with sleeves that billow while his arms rest at his sides, they cuff at the wrists with red, jeweled buttons.

Those pants?  

Fitted. Unapologetically tailored. They scream across the breadth of his hips. Sloane can’t help herself—her sight catches on the bulge pressed down his left thigh. Thighs, mind you, with quads so defined they declare themselves through the fabric. He’s tucked them into his riding boots with an almost careless slouch, as if they weren’t worth a second thought.

Dain wears his broadness like a warning, posture ramrod straight, every motion tight and practiced, for him, relaxing might compromise his structural integrity. He doesn’t fidget while she picks him apart either. Honestly, he could’ve shown up in just those calf-high boots and she’d have followed him into the night sky—or let him take her there.

*“Goodness, woman,” Thoirt gasps,*

*"Oh don't you give me that—aren't Cath's scales just the perfect shade of crimson—"* she mocks Thoirt from weeks ago, because she *never* forgets when her daggertail starts gushing about Tairn and Cath.

*“Repeating your parents doesn’t make you wise, little one.”* she tsk-tsk's Sloane, in her own draconic way and Sloane rears back in the den of their bond.

*"Parents? I didn't know you and Cath were married; you didn't even invite me to the wedding. I'll never forgive you."*

*"I don't want to eclipse the one you're headed to now, Love, in fact—"*

"—Sloane?"

Dain’s voice snaps her attention back to him. He’s standing just inside the threshold of her barracks door, watching her with mahogany eyes and the faintest pout curled into his mouth,

"You were sleeping?"

He laughs, reaches out his hand and grazes the skin of her cheek with the back of his fingers, "You've got those sleep lines engraved into your skin."

She leans into the touch, and as her eyes flutter closed at the warmth, his hand uncurls and his palm cups her cheek. He slides his thumb over her bottom lip; the action is charmingly intimate of him, very, daresay, *un-Dain* of him,

"Need a raincheck?"

His voice struggles through the last few syllables, dragging into a tone much heavier than he'd used earlier; when she opens her eyes his are on her, searching her face, her body,

"No... but I hate that you got dressed up for me and my uniform is all I have to offer."

His hand slides from her cheek down to her throat, over her collarbone, then her shoulder and Dain traces the silhouette of her waist and hip. He doesn’t deny that he dressed up for her, and it makes her stomach flop,

"This is *more* than enough." he sighs.

He devours her with his unrelenting focus, pupils shaking slightly as his gaze bounces all over her person.

"Not for me."

She doesn’t mean the outfit. Not really.

It’s the circles under her eyes, the tension knotted into her shoulders, the way her body feels half-adrift from sleep and weeks of restraint. He’s dressed like a dream and she’s barely stitched together.

Sloane looks like she just rolled out of a war zone, and he looks like the lead in a fucking ballad. Not exactly the reunion aesthetic she’d envisioned.

Dain tilts his head, eyes lingering on her mouth before flicking to the stairs. 

“Then let’s get you into something comfortable.”

---

He takes her to a boutique called *Mila's,* it caters only to women and that makes Sloane lift a blonde brow,

"Any particular reason you picked here?"

She asks out of simple curiosity while he hovers behind her, eyes noting every article of clothing she touches. His figure engulfs hers, and from behind it seems he’s the one pushing hangars of dresses and skirts side-to-side.

Dain answers immediately and innocently enough:

"Don and Blue spent like twenty gold in here last week." He grunts and crosses his arms while blowing a damp curl that falls across his nose and eyelashes, "Figured if they're wasting their money so obscenely it must be worth it."

"Squadron?"

"Yes; Blue is one of our rider's and Don is a flier."

*Mila's* isn't some casual premade, mass-produced, clothing store—it's an *experience*. When they'd walked in they were greeted by a tailor who hadn't left their side since; she floated from section to section as Sloane perused and Dain scrutinized everything she hadn't looked at with a coppery glare. After a few minutes had passed they were both offered teacups filled with hot black tea that must've been steeped in Dain's eyes because they were precisely the same swatch of color.

Sloane takes in the store itself; a combination of wood paneling and dark slate stonework, crown-molded ceilings, and swept stone flooring. It was definitely the kind of shop she'd take herself too for indulgence,

"Are you... looking for anything specific?" Dain asks, pawing through the shelves just ahead of her,
  
Sloane tilts her head back and answers while staring at the bottom of his chin. A thick gash, long-healed, runs along his jaw where no hair grows. She wonders how he got it.

"I want you to pick what you think would look good on me." she whispers, leaning back against his front.

Dain's head tips down slightly, "But I can't figure out what *you* like if I do that."

"Yes you can. If I don't like it I'll tell you."

There's a stubborn pause, and his jaw ticks, but he gives in, "Fine."

"Lead the way then," Sloane coos, "I'll tell you what colors I like to help: white, green, and brown."

She’s never let anyone do this for her before.

The thought comes quietly, unexpected. It’s not anything dangerous or revealing, but it’s _normal_. Letting someone else pick your clothes. Letting someone else wonder what would look good on you. Letting someone else try.

It tickles something in her, that soft part buried under the killing, the training, the war-bound womanhood shaped by weapons and orders and sleepless nights. The part of her that’s still just... a girl. The kind who might’ve gone shopping with a lover. Or tried on things she didn’t need. Or flirted with the mirror until she made herself laugh.

She bounces out of his space with a grin that costs her nothing but his time.

The tailor claps excitedly but doesn't speak; she wears a small smile and glances between the two eagerly, “I’m certain the Sir has outstanding tastes.”

Sloane almost huffs out an annoyed exhale—of course he does, fucking look at him.

It should be a crime to make clothes look so good, and how dare they wear *him.*

"Which is your favorite?" Dain asks while looking at boots after acknowledging the worker with a dismissive nod,

"Slate Grey."

His face scrunches, "Grey?"

"It's more blue, like a really smokey, pale, blue. But officially the color is Slate Grey; think overcast skies."

"Slate Grey. But blue." he repeats, lifting his head scanning the store like a hunting hound,

"Yup," Sloane squints at him, "What colors do you like?"

Dain runs his thumb against against a blouse tucked away between a pile of skirts,

"...Black."

Ugh, what a *boy.* Sloane tuts once and chews her bottom lip; she supposes that's nicer than getting the go-to *"blue, like your eyes.*"

"And your favorite color?"

"Marigold. Deep Marigold. It's the color just after Cath's pupils."

Sloane blinks.

It’s not just an odd answer. It’s an _intimate_ one. The kind that speaks to memorization and familiarity so long-standing it’s become unconscious. Dain doesn’t compare the color to flowers or silks or sunrise. He compares it to _Cath_. To the smallest flicker of gold in his dragon’s eye that no one else would ever think to name it. The same color she’d noticed just hours earlier while avoiding it all the same.

And not even the sclera—his _pupil_. Just after the center.

She’s never heard a rider talk about their dragon like that. Not in passing, not when pressed. Most describe their bonds in terms of might, of weaponry, of partnership. But this is something... different. It feels personal.

_Devotional._

No wonder Cath never leaves him alone, she thinks.

He pauses just ahead of a shelf full of grey skirts and glances at her before claiming one, "Small?"

"In tops and bottoms," she watches as he pulls a medium length skirt her size across his forearm, "Except coats and jackets, I prefer a size up."

Dain's head bobs in a slow succession of nods, then to the tailor her requests, "Could I have two of those, in a small—one cream and one black. And that, please."

Two blouses with scrunched, exposed-shoulder necklines, and one dress, slitted like her formal uniform's skirt, and with a high neckline in a color close to what she told him was her favorite. He takes only just seconds to secure some boots, *tall* ones, they end just past the knee.


Dain hands one of the blouses, and the dress to the assistant, then the boots, the cream blouse, and the grey skirt to her,

"Put that on, give them your uniform and boots to the clerk, and meet me out front."

"Yes sir, *wingleader,* sir." she sings, and salutes him after the handoff of clothing.

Dain rolls his eyes and swivels on his heel to the front counter to pay.

*"Going well so far, Love?"*

Thoirt speaks once she's in a fitting room, and locking the stall door, bootless,

*"It is."* Sloane answers, *"Are you with Cath?"*

*"He hunts."*

*"Awe,"* she sticks her bottom lip out for extra pout, *"Could've been a double-date."*

Thoirt heaves a heavy breath and grunts, *"No need for courting to such an extent; I get what I want without such measures."*

*"Oh Mistress Thoirt, my apologies for assuming you'd ever deign the same practices as I."* Sloane guffaws, *"Too bad though, his rider seems so nice."*

She doesn't answer, but she does expose a flicker of contentedness through their bond before closing the door to Liam's room in their bond.

Before Sloane heads to meet Dain at the front of the store she stops to take a look at herself; she wants to see what *he* wanted to see.

And the sight is beautiful.

It's entirely feminine.

Her grey, silk-wool skirt isn’t just a skirt—it feeds seamlessly into a corset she laces tight, cinching herself into shape before tucking the butterfly-winged blouse he picked out into it. The neckline leaves her clavicle completely bare, dipping just to the tops of her breasts. It isn’t racy, but it’s still far more than any man at Basgiath was used to seeing.

Her knee-high boots begin exactly where her skirt ends, and everything about the outfit feels beautifully fluid. The fabric feathers and billows as she walks through the store, each movement brushing into the next like it’s been rehearsed. Her sleeves stretch far past her forearms, soft and trailing, and with her hair unbound and her silhouette reshaped, she feels like a version of herself no one’s seen before—lighter, finer, almost otherworldly.

Dain turns red the moment he sees her.

His mouth opens, then closes again. He blinks hard, like she’s something he wasn’t prepared for.

“Shit, Sloane," he's blinking rapidly, his eyes searching everywhere but her face,

"Are you sure *you* want this?"

She tilts her head, "The clothes? Do you want me to pay you? You didn't need to—"

"No." he shakes his hands, "Money is absolutely not an issue."

"Then what is?"

Regret and indecision can come as quick as a person's next breath, and now to Sloane, Dain seems like he might hold a few negative inclinations to this date he asked for. 

His question hits her like a slap in the face, harsher than it should be because she doesn't understand it. She can't understand why he would ask it now. They'd already reached a place where their feelings for each other weren't unknown, or unusual. Or so she thought,

Maybe the weight of what happened to him is finally catching up, pressing in where no one else can see. Maybe she reminds him of the parts he lost, or the version of himself he’s not sure he’ll get back.

Maybe she is part of the cost.

And that thought doesn’t bleed so much as it downright hurts.

She tells herself she should be accustomed rejection by now. Should’ve built up calluses to this kind of intimacy. But knowing that doesn’t make it hurt any less. 

He gently steers her away from the storefront, guiding her to stand beside a low planter where a young pine tree grows. It shelters them from view, though only in one direction.

“I don't want you to regret attempting this with me—I think about how much I overwhelmed Violet a lot, and I would rather you at least not come to hate me—"

"But I *don't* hate you." she hisses.

And *Violet, Violet, Violet.* It’s as if he has nothing to base his feelings on besides a singular failed romance with a childhood friend.

She’d always made an effort to not think about what went on between the two of them in their earliest days, but the more it became evident how much she meant to him in that way, the more Sloane finds it harder to fight the curiosity. And, unfortunately, the scathing jealousy that paired with it like rich cheese to a dry wine.

Dain tucks her bangs behind her ears, his eyes are so fucking void of happiness her heart stops, and those thoughts yield, "*Yet.*"

He drops his hand and takes a step back, and she thinks of the one Cath took from him,

"Yet." he repeats.

"Why are you so comfortable with keeping yourself halfway invested into anything?" she snaps, anger rising from behind her worry, overtaking her *fear,*

"I'm not halfway invested." he responds with just as much heat, if not more.

"Then what's the point of planting doubt in my mind this far along? Are we both supposed to be perpetually alone and never enjoying anything for ourselves? I don't get it."

He bends toward her and grabs her hands, engulfing them completely in his own as he presses them to his chest—

—she might still be fucking pissed at him, but she has to close her eyes just to stop herself from squeezing, because _Godsdamn,_ they feel like perfectly firm pillows.

"I already told you how I feel about you, and I just want you to know I’m not going to hide it if you keep getting farther into this bed with me, Sloane—"

She exhales sharply, the sound laced with disbelief. "I’ve been trying to get in your bed for weeks, you fucking dork."

"I meant it metaphorically," he stammers, blushing deeper now.

"Dain, I’m fine with this. With _you._ I like how you see me—how you treat me. I like how you make me feel about myself, and about what comes next. And I like the way you show up for the people around you, even with the shit you've dealt with."

She lets him take it in, watches the color drain from his cheeks as something more determined settles in.

"I want someone to want me the way you do. Unabashedly and aggressively."

He pulls her in, arms curling around her waist. "You’re sure you want to know _me_?"

"As much as I want you to know me."

"And how much is that?"

She grins, then rises onto her toes, the new boots creaking faintly beneath her weight.

Her hands drift to his jaw, thumbs brushing the edge of that old scar. She kisses him without hesitation, but not hurried—deep and slow and steady, because she wants him to feel every inch of it. There’s no coyness in it, no bite of teasing. Just her, and all the calm certainty she can give him.

His breath catches against her mouth, and then his eyes finally close.

She lets it last. Lets it settle. And when she finally pulls away, his eyes don’t open right away. He stays where he is, still bent toward her, like he hasn’t quite remembered how to move yet.

When they flutter open, slow and dazed and searching, she whispers—

“More than I can show you with words, Dain."

He exhales softly through his nose, like he’s trying to steady himself, or trying to expel all the doubt that's been diseasing him. Then he leans his forehead into hers—until the tremors she hadn’t noticed before finally stop.

---

*Divine* is seated only a few plots down from the migrant villages, tucked between the commercial and residential sectors; from its place, you could see Amari’s temple in the distance, watching over the town like a sentinel.

“I’ve been here a few times; my fliers like to indulge in good eats, they’re quite the group of gourmands.”

She should be listening, but she’s still focused on their hands—his fingers around hers, his thumb occasionally brushing the crook between them like it’s accidental.

*Gods*, he has huge hands. And that voice; calm, certain, amused by things she hasn’t even said yet. It feels like it’s curving into her ear every time he speaks.

She looks up, caught in it, flustered by how easily he’s filling the space around her. “Have you spent most of your time with them while you’ve been here?”

Her voice lifts slightly, trying to sound casual. It isn’t. And it’s carried up to him by one of the last warm breezes they’ll have as the summer inevitably ends and Dain casts his decadent chocolate-y gaze on her,

“They take whatever’s left of my time—when it isn’t already claimed by Cat, Maren, or Vi and her family.”

The moon catches on his cheekbone as he says it. Lantern light slips across his throat, gilding the lines of it in amber—the notch of his collarbone, the exposed dip just above where his shirt parts.

Her gaze slips to the bob of his Adam’s apple, to the scruff that begins in an artful fade along his neck. His beard being trimmed in a more Poromish looking style suited him so well that she found herself wondering if all that was ever wrong with Dain had been Navarre and existing there.

Aretian-Dain-Aetos created a heat between her legs that might have her roll over on her back with her belly exposed.

“Divine is a fusion restaurant; it’s a combination of Krovlish cuisine, particularly Poromish and Deverelli foods.”

His brow bone pinches in thought and she tilts her head in question when his gait slows,

“I picked here based on the ambience, but it’s mostly because I haven’t had anything off the menu I haven’t liked—and it changes weekly..” His lips pull tight into a worried line, “I like really spicy food though, and most of it is either spicy or savory. Though now that you’re with me I feel I should’ve asked what you liked first.”

The weight of his consideration infects her and Sloane grins, “Ambience is important for a first date so my expectations are high.”

“You won’t be anything less than impressed, I promise.”

His voice is so damn soft and smooth that she her legs nearly fold to match it’s depth,

“I’m sure I can find something I enjoy.”

Dain nods, pulls her close when another couple brushes too close to her, “We can do a *tour* if the owner is in, she recognizes all of us at this point.”

“What’s a tour?” She sidesteps into him and he snakes his arm around her waist,

“You get to pick a few entrees and they’re served in quarter portions with a pitcher of a mixed drink, and water.”

“That sounds perfect then.”

He smiles again, effectively punches her right in the chest with straight teeth and smile so boyishly joyful that she *swoons.*

Somewhere between the mount posts and the steady rise of voices from the crowd ahead, her thoughts drift.

Sloane isn’t used to this—not the interest, not even the affection, but the wanting. The impulse to know him fully, to be known in return. With  others, there had been no need to give anything real. No instinct to linger on the details. It had all been simple: flirting. They had liked the shape of her she was willing to show—sharp when needed, detached when it counted.

What is she supposed to say? What kind of questions are enough? What version of herself is she meant to hand over, now that it feels like the stakes are higher than anything she’s done before?

The closer they get to the entrance, the more tightly wound she becomes, half caught in the hope that she won’t have to speak first, half terrified that she might. So she lets him guide her through the noise, lets the pressure of his palm at the small of her back distract her from the quiet scramble inside, and tells herself she’ll figure it out when she has to.

Dain doesn’t speak again until they reach the entrance of restaurant.

Closer to it they’re forced to shrink themselves within the growing crowd of passing townsfolk, busy mingling amongst themselves and notably, the migrant families from both Draithus and Poromiel. Dain pulls Sloane in front of himself as if they’re dancing in the sweeping Grand Halls of Calldyr masquerade venues; pulling her hand high above her head and turning his forearm, forcing her to twist ahead.

He watches her as her eyes bounce along the buildings and people, soaking in the delicate normalcy of the moment. She laughs as her spin comes to an end and he rewards her with crinkled eyes and another heart-stopping smile,

“Is it nice, being back home right?” He says as Divine’s hand carved sign lingers ahead, “You seem happy.” 

*Home.* 

he could spit the word back at him and walk away, but how uncalled for would that be? It's not Dain's fault she was so far removed from the word conceptually—and it certainly wasn't his fault the home she'd been fostered in made sure she would never recover from that day and week following.

Sloane giggles, “You seem more at home than me,”

“I feel like it.”

Dain wraps an arm around her shoulders and clavicle as he knits them through the crowd. He’s kind enough, aggressively respectful in the way he rasps *pardon me* and *with your permission,* in his perfectly enunciated Tyrrish. He reaches around the obscenely large door pulls and guides them both into a setting so unlike the town outside that Sloane stumbles slightly on entry, jaw half-dropped.

The restaurant dips inward with recessed seating carved into the floor itself, the sunken pits lined with thick cushions and wide throws in bright Poromish reds and pomegranate-toned florals. Tall tables rise from the center of each ring like polished altars, each one etched with different motifs: gryphons, oceans, twin suns.  

Above them, lamp fixtures hang from the high ceiling in a sprawl of asymmetry—hammered brass and iron domes pierced with patterns that scatter blood-orange light across the space. That light reflects off every woven surface, splashing over carved wooden walls and patterned textiles in flashes of vermilion, turquoise, and indigo.

Partitioned nooks wrap around the perimeter, some with gauzy curtains drawn halfway closed, others left open with groups lounging on layered rugs, their shoes abandoned at the edges. Laughter moves through the space like a current—low and continuous—undercut with the clatter of porcelain and the warm hush of shared conversation.

Sloane takes it in slowly, the scent of baked spices and sweetened smoke curling around her.

“Here,” Dain holds out a hand to her, stepping down the cascading stairwell, though it’s only a few steps deep and shallow, “Careful,”

“Thank you.”

She blinks down at him and takes it, focusing on the stairs,

“Second Lieutenant Aetos?”

“Giana,” 

Sloane watches Dain’s face piece together in the warmth of the restaurant into something close to admiration and affection—a less intense way that he looks her,

“I was hoping you’d be here.” He chuckles, eyes nearly closed at how hard he smiles, Sloane squints in the radiance of it,

“Well I am, and you have *gorgeous* company with you today; it’s nice to meet you Missus,”

“Likewise,” Sloane answers with a soft bow that’s returned and Dain pulls her close.

Giana is dressed in a completely deep red uniform; silk trousers and a billowing, backless, blouse, but unlike the rest of the staff that mouses through the establishment, she bears no name tag and wears no waist apron,

“I know it isn’t his, but is it your first time here?”

Sloane looks around, “It is, and it’s *beautiful.”*

She’s never been to restaurant where patrons were seated on the floor in embossed, tiled divots. Everyone seemed pleasantly comfortable enough, and lost in the ambience as much as she was.

“Well thank you; I must admit good men will always have great taste.”

Sloane lifts a brow and Giana’s matured voice tilts into a rough chortle, “My husband is an architect; famous in Poromiel for his progressive designs.”

Dain tugs her hand when Giana spins around, she leads them to particularly central table with a trellised partition of vining plants and lanterns, then gestures for them to sit.  Dain doesn’t until she does—and he drops gracefully into the molded cushion directly next to her as Giana disappears into a crowd of customers and staff,

“Is it always this busy?” Sloane asks him, leaning forward so that her voice catches as he removes her boots, and then his own.

He sets their shoes directly behind them, pausing to cradle her ankle in his hand. She thinks he might be noticing how small it is in his hands, the way she is while watching him, and then turns to face her.

“It’s pretty tame while the sun sets—they don’t open till the late evening. Soon as the suns dead and gone though,” he nods at the musicians beating away at hand drums and shaking bells, at the young boy around her age who picks at the strings of his lute, 

“It transforms.”

“I really like this… it’s so…”

She can’t find the words for it. Exotic could certainly be a contender to describe the decor, she leans back into pillows the size of her date with braided covers and tufted corners—but the mood in here? It feels… *inviting,* contrasting of the foreign decor and music.

Dain spreads a bifold of thick parchment ahead of them on their table and drops his head down to her, “Pick whatever you want.”

Sloane once-overs the menu—and the *prices.*

Is this man insane?

“Should we split—“

“An appetizer?” He pokes at the menu, “Do you like spicy food?”

Sloane leans forward in disbelief, “Do you see these prices—“

“Hmm,” his head turns to the menu, then without moving his head he looks down at her, “What prices?”

Sloane scoffs at him, she pulls her hair over a shoulder then points at the numbers; the first set in Krovlish characters, and the second in the common tongue, “*These*, Mr. Money Bags.”

“Those shouldn't be any of your concern.” He rumbles gruffly, “You aren’t paying for it.”

“One of these appetizers is like four drinks at Chantara.”

“Better enjoy it then. I have a few dishes in mind that should be manageable, I'll order them.”

"I like that you just—" she stops and he leans towards her,

"You like that I what?"

"Don't take this out of term." she warns, “I like that you just… decide things. Handle it. It’s attractive, okay?”

His face devolves into complete confusion, "I don't think most people like how imposing I tend to be."

"Well, when it's like this I can just be a girl, you know? Be pretty and simple."

He reads over the menu, more so dissects it with a face she'd seen often while in the sparring gyms, the one placid and void of anything besides judgement, "There's way more to you than pretty and simple."

"And you know that, it's enough for me. So, what am I eating tonight?"

He looked so composed now, dressed to charm and ready to make the night hers, but she still remembered the way he’d faltered earlier. The momentary cracks. The tremors he hadn’t meant to show.

"Are you... okay? After what was done to you? I don't mean to ruin the mood but I can't just avoid it for the sake of the mood."

The question throws him off so badly he has to lean back to process, and he doesn't look at her while answering,

“It's been liberating to finally know how much I never meant to someone I loved.”

Sloane's neck jerks at his admission.

It’s more painful than anything she could’ve imagined. Losing loving parents was one thing, but learning you were _never_ loved at all? That was a different kind of cruelty, and one that had clearly been festering beneath his skin. It brings her back to him questioning her outside of _Mila’s_ and how she’d instantly assumed the root of his insecurity was Violet.

She hadn’t considered the possibility that his relationship with his father might’ve _looked_ like love for most of his life. That maybe the illusion had only shattered recently, maybe even because of Violet.

And now? Dain is simmering in his own questions. About his father. About what Cath really sees in him. About what anything means and if it ever meant anything at all.

Of _course_ he would question her intentions. She’d invaded his head once before, deliberately, and he doesn’t want to be hurt again. Not if he can reason his way out of it first. He might even think this thing between them is her way of getting back at him for Liam.  

Her way of inflicting the same pain he thought he gave her.

"I know we haven't lost our parents in the same way, but I'm still sorry."

"It's mutual." he says plainly, he lets his eyes fall to his lap and then lifts his chin again, "But we have Cath and Thoirt, so we'll be fine."

Running to his comfort, his dragon, makes a lip-strained smile stretch wide across her face and while she doesn't wish to replace Cath she finds herself hoping she could bring that grade of calm to him eventually.

The heaviness of the moment is taken by a waitress who takes their order, given by Dain, and moments later as they speak about the happenings of late, the food arrives and Sloane's eyes flare,

"I can smell the heat off one of these—you said you like spicy food, not tastebud deleting."

Dain grins, "I promise you'll have all your tastebuds afterwards, just try it,"

He lifts a wooden stick of skewered meat glistening in a red-orange glaze and plated atop a salad of sautéed vegetables. There's only two of the skewers and their placed on a long, wooden tray with six other steaming dishes. When she takes the skewer he pours them both a glass of a heated beverage,

"Even the drinks are hot?" she huffs, "Is this a trial?"
 
"It's not unusual for Krovlan drinks to be served hot." He schools her in a way that doesn't surprise her. "Near the Barrens, some nights are unbearably close to freezing and drop even past that in the winter months, hence everything being spicy. They call this *Fools Heat*"

She sniffs the meat; it smells like honey and some kind of pepper that burns the hair in her nose and then offers an apology in the sweet scent beneath it's heat,

"I'm going to try this, and I swear if I don't have my tastebuds after you'll be answering to Thoirt."

He's already finished the other kebab and speaks only after swallowing, "I'll just send Cath, he ignores me whenever she's around anyway."

"Same, but around Tairn too."

As Sloane chews Dain's face adopts an expression she's never seen before; his eyes narrow into mischievous amber-brown discs, and a tight-lipped smile pulls at the edges of his mouth,

"Oh? *Tairn* too?"

The heat of the chicken makes her eyes water, but it's quickly subdued by the honey-citrus glaze that's been cured over it—it's *delicious.* She wonders if this is spicy to him, or if this is just a controlled version of what he enjoys. 

"Yeah, also I meant to tell you when I saw you," she has to pause to manage some of the heat still lingering in her mouth, "I got you a graduation gift, and I know you'll like it."

She wipes away the food induced tears and places the hand sized box on their table just before the spread of food, in the ambience of *Divine's* lighting the wooden box seems more red than it does sequoia,

"Are you okay?" Dain asks before carefully picking it up after wiping his hands off on a folded napkin, "I picked the sweeter heats for you."

"Sweet heats?" Sloane coughs, and reaches for the glass of Fool's Heat he'd poured for her earlier,

"You go out with your fliers to their haunts to commit spicy-mouthed suicides?"

His shoulder's tremble when he laughs while opening the box and it's hinges creak.

"We don't—"

Dain's face pieces together into silent astonishment.

"Sloane this is beautiful."

She had spent *hours* in stationary stores in Navarre the last week; she frequented them like a ghost, face glued to glass display cases and squirming at prices. She'd finally managed to pick an ink pen for Dain that was hand carved from red sunstone and inlaid with deep walnut wood and gold metal details. She'd even bought an inkwell to match and had it prefilled with quick drying ink,

"Figured you should have something as precise and dramatic as you are. It even judges you if you angle it toward the light."

He does and she nearly spits out her drink, laughing while he watches the way the crystals dazzle in the lantern light, he press his thumbpad against the engraved nib after removing the cap, "I like this a lot, is this glass around the stone?"

"Yep, so don't drop it. No big deal or anything, but I wandered around Navarre for six hours slowly bankrupting myself. Totally casual. Also It's kind of a bulkier pen because you have huge hands and I think—"

Dain finishes his drink and grips the back of her neck firmly, dragging her face up to his at just the right angle. His hand is _hot_ against her skin, his grip unrelenting, and when he kisses her—_Gods_—it’s with the full weight of everything she's been craving.

The first kiss burns through her mouth like the Fool’s Heat, laced with spice and sugars and the residual sweetness from the drink. But then he goes in for more, again and again, his mouth claiming her in slow, heady passes like he’s starved for her. By the fifth kiss, the sixth, a moan slips out of her throat and he drinks it down like it’s what he came for.

When he finally pulls away, he looks _delirious._

His chest rises unevenly. His lips are parted. And his eyes, his eyes are so dark they’re almost black, his pupils blown wide like he hasn’t caught his breath in minutes.

She’s stunned by it, how undone he looks every time they kiss. Like she’s some rare intoxication he’s only just discovered and can’t stop sampling. He drowns in her, every time. Never rushed, never shallow—each kiss is full, slow, meant to _ruin her._

"Is this why you sat next to me?" she gasps, they linger close enough that she still feels his breath on her face.

Dain's eyes rise from her lips reluctantly, "I knew I'd get one eventually."

"You're undeniably overindulgent, because that was like six." Sloane closes the last bit of space between them when she scoots closer and he scowls,

"There's no safe zone now—_and it was eight._"

She licks her bottom lip and glances around the restaurant. No one is watching them. No one judging, whispering, picking them apart with prying eyes and open mouths. It's still only the two of them here, tucked into this lush little pocket of warmth and spice. This space Dain calls familiar, where he’s brought _her_, and smothered her in everything he finds good and glittering and gold.

And _Loial's sake_, does she feel it. All that attention. All that quiet devotion, carved into every detail of this night. 

She’s full of him already, and he’s only just touched her mouth.

"If you can handle me, you don't need a safe zone," she teases, and lets her hand slide over his thigh to prove her point. He _squirms_ when she brushes over that bulge she’d clocked earlier—just bold enough to make him flinch, just slow enough to feel him twitch _into_ her touch.

...It feels much bigger than it had looked earlier and she chances a glance downwards before ripping her eyes away and back to him,

"Safe zones are standard procedure." he shivers while ducking away from her watchful stare; his breath is irreparably lost, molten and dragging across the unspoken lust between them, "Getting groped by your date during your first date is not."

"I'd say anything about us is far from standard." She removes her hand, but only after torturing him more by dragging it down in the opposite direction till her palm rests against the safer, lower half of his thigh. His own stutter against his drink that he reaches for.

"I agree, so we should work to achieve some sort of normalcy."

Dain’s analogy about distance is cute. Safe zones: the buffer between riders and their dragons, especially others’, to avoid accidental stomping while grounded or mid-air collisions.

But she doesn’t need space between them. She doesn’t want it. She wants to be decimated entirely by the flames of his affection—turned to ash by whatever else might be in store.

Sloane locks eyes with him, takes in the matte blush lazing against his ears, his neck, even across his knuckles. His lips are thick and swelling, and he doesn’t even realize he’s pouting as he tries to steady his breathing.

"Normal’s cute. Delusional, but cute."

"Delusional is a state of being for me, so we should be fine."

“Then you should probably start praying I’m a phase. I’d hate to be your permanent problem.”

The air between their faces scorch and he smiles so addictively bright and sated that she rewards him with another kiss, a light peck, but with the full press of her mouth.

When he opens his eyes, they don’t quite focus right away. His lashes lift slowly, like it takes effort to pull himself back from wherever she just dragged him, and when those espresso-dark irises finally settle on her, they’re clouded—not just with heat. They're starved and singular, something marinated in quiet obsession and possessiveness that makes her feel like prey in the strangest, most seductive way.

It's like she’s already been claimed and he’s just waiting for her to understand it.

"My prayers have been answered then, because you're all I've asked for."
