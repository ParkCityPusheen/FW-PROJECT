**DAIN**


During Dain's enrollment at Basgiath, death had been acceptable, sickly expected and often encouraged: cadets died. Be it simple, foolish, or accidental, it felt as though death were part of the coursework, as if there had never been a line to cross in the name of graduation.

His flier counterparts, both within the squadron and those now stationed indefinitely in Aretia, held different beliefs entirely. Death to them was an acceptable outcome only in flight tactics or formal duels; the Poromish in particular encouraged unity, empathy, and loyalty within their ranks. These values stood starkly in contrast to the nastiness Navarre cultured into its cadets. Death was simply a tool they used to manage their facade, to fool and control their own people, to continue manufacturing unfeeling, foolish, flesh-wearing weapons augmented with dragons who cared little to correct them.

And loyalty?

There was none.

Only fraternal unity in belonging to a Wing, a far cry from legitimized loyalty.

Being a Flightleader offered Dain the perfect shield to pursue his natural curiosity about Poromish ways, curiosity that would have been met with suspicion from those still bound by Navarre's narrow worldview. Reading about a people and living amongst them were vastly different experiences as he'd discovered in Deverelli and across the Isles.

He wanted to know if the values lost while burying the existence of wyvern and venin could be instilled in the generations to come, if he could help redraft what it meant to be a rider and not simply Navarrian.

Additionally, a jointly operational unit was remarkably progressive for both nations. Dragons operating in the wake of gryphons should have been impossible considering both beasts' egos, but the threat of venin forced unnatural alliances; besides that, they could communicate with one another perfectly well without human intervention and held no vendettas beyond their pride and it made perfectly good sense to work alongside them rather than them with humans. With the help of Syrena and Kingston he'd managed to guide both creatures through the processes of establishing a formal agreement, a convenient allegiance, to help Squadron achieve its objective of the eradication of venin. Thinking back to it, the whole thing had just been time consuming rather than difficult.

Cath and Vantaraine, Sven's monstrosity of a gryphon, were easy to agree and quicker to put the pieces in place.

Still, being a Flightleader ultimately lacked the weight that should place a freshly promoted lieutenant in the presence of both nations' Kings' advisors, a duchess, and the Aretian generals.

Dain shifts his gaze across the assembly chamber table to Brennan and arches a single, disbelieving brow at the oldest Sorrengail as Violet reviews expenditure reports and tax collection obligations regarding the newly erected migrant villages. They've been arguing for what feels like hours about the irrationality in taxing the families who've fled the comfort of their homes for protection; in his heart, Dain knows that the effort in doing so is unethical, but in his mind he recognizes it's very much a Navarre-esque methodology.

He's not sure where the advisors think these haggard families will consolidate the funds to pay taxes from—possibly the space in King Tauri's advisors' heads where a fucking brain was supposed to be.

Through his thoughts, Violet's voice rises as she stands firmly on her ground of taxing nobility with Tyrrish residencies and Brennan finally meets Dain's eyes just to roll his own. Calm prickles at the edges of his consciousness, and though it's invasive and not his own, he welcomes it. He needs it. His fingers dig into his biceps, the only movement betraying his restraint, while Violet argues on until General Ferris’s patience shatters and his palms crack against the table.

"We've discussed the pecuniary interests of the Tyrrish quite enough. The war effort is summoned here and they've been waiting patiently. If you wanted to discuss monetary topics you should've done so with the correct audience."

A hush falls upon the chamber from his fiery outburst,

"Navarre's lack of consideration is nothing to be surprised by, as such we <i>are</i> moving on." he continues, before leaning back into his chair with an overdramatic huff of breath.

"I agree," Violet says with a pointed glance at the advisors, crossing her legs at the knee and placing her hands delicately in her lap overtop an emerald studded dagger. "We've wasted enough time on their petty concerns."

"Monetary checks and balances are not petty concerns, your Grace."

Violet's eyes snap to the tallest advisor, Vance, "They are, considering our lives actively hang in the balance of the impending threat just a province over. Or would you rather talk taxes with them as they drain you for all your worth, which for the record couldn't be much considering the conversation up to this point Vance."

She tips her head to Dain and his fliers before Vance can respond, all in rigid ranks behind him. "Lieutenant Colonel Kingston, Lieutenant Aetos?" 

The two stand in effortless, synchronized movements. Dain just after Mira, and Kingston close to Syrena. Kingston looks over to the Lieutenant for approval and upon receiving a stiff nod from Dain his voice booms through the room and escapes into the upper parlor where the unit's riders are seated neatly in rows.

Dain observes the disgust spread across the advisors' faces; standing during a conference to present one's testimony was a Poromish culture. It gave an individual, or in their case the unit, the attention they warranted. Yet, they remain calm, collected, and bound unintentionally by Sven's gift that threads simmering agitation into their skin in the face of obvious scrutiny. 

The Breavick born flier practically pierces through Dain's consciousness and he can feel Gale doing his best to wash away Sven's inherent aggravation with his own aloofness.

He wants to sigh, to drag out an exhausted breath at how invasive fliers’ gifts tend to be.

"Councilors." 

Kingston's voice is harsh and low, and he keeps his verbiage clipped, necessary, as he addresses the council: 'As instructed by his highness King Tauri, Squadron Zero's expedition begins in Draithus and will remain northbound. Based on the limitations of gryphon, dragon, and their bond alike, rest days include two during the first movement in Samara and Montserrat.'

Another of the advisors leans forward, Noid, the same who accused Dain of presenting a faux head-sized gemstone and procured Cath's ire all in a single sentence. Dain watches as the man's face contorts with the same dramatic flair that had nearly gotten him killed before.

"<i>First</i> movement?" Councilor Noid heaves, eyes wide as if his family pet had been slain cold-blood in broad daylight.

Dain observes the familiar faces around the table. Noid had been appointed simply because his family had been for decades, Vance because he was a slimy fuck like most of Navarre's nobility, and lastly there was Amaryllis.

Amaryllis was the only of the three he could stomach; she genuinely respected riders and held dragons in high regard. Of course she hated fliers loudly, and passionately, but Dain couldn’t undo brainwashing all on his own and she was far too gone in systemic lying to be convinced otherwise.

"Yes, your excellency," Kingston reiterates; he speaks to Noid like a parent would their child,  "the first."

Kingston bows his head just enough to meet the expectation of openly displayed respect in formal settings before gesturing to Dain to carry the conversation.

Dain allows himself a moment before speaking, organizing his thoughts and then presenting them expertly:

"The second movement will begin prior to leaving Montserrat, eastbound for Cygnisen. In accordance with King Tauri’s permissions, Squadron will begin a southern flight in convergence with the Summit-Peak Drift and Breavick's Desert Drift for survey support—"

"<i>Cygnisen?</i> <i>Survey support?</i> This was—"

“Once the survey is completed—” 

Noid shakes a gnarled finger at Dain and the sight of it makes him want heave. His fingernails are long and thick and yellowing like his skin underneath the expensive fabric that slides down his wrist to reveal his hand.

"<i>You</i> serve His Highness King Tauri—"

Radomirka's interruption is quick, voice snapping the stagnant chamber atmosphere, and rising over both the Councilor and Dain himself. He almost smiles when the advisors' eyes all widen at her tone as the Major speaks,

"My Lieutenant wasn't finished." 

She admonishes them with her eyes slanted in their direction, not deigning to turn her head in the slightest while maintaining her bearing.

He catches both Drake and Seryna Cordella leaning forward with their lips drawn tight to avoid smirking.

"Squadron Zero will then proceed through Breavick, rest in Cordyn and conclude the tour in Aretia."

Amaryllis is the first to reject the flight plan; unlike the two men she works with, she doesn't place emotion and bias at the forefront of her reasoning.

"King Tauri expects a thorough patrol of Navarre's borders to maintain the integrity of our wards’ boundary lines while Aretia recovers from the recent attack, and further north as a preemptive measure."

Dain hardly blinks when he answers the century-old Councilor, "Which is achieved in the expedition's first movement."

She looks over at him with greying eyes and a shaking head, "It was not mentioned that the unit would venture into Poromish territories."

"As a jointly obligated command, it is our responsibility and duty to also maintain the integrity of Poromish borders, is it not? We serve two kings; if you are unfamiliar with the unit’s obligations, Councilor, I suggest you review them."

"I've read the official documentation, Lieutenant Aetos."

"The kingdom-sanctioned documentation. Stating exactly that, and—"

Amaryllis throws up her hands, the light from above captures against her gold bracelets, "Please, spare me all the elementary detail."

"Then I'll move on." His shoulders drop, the tension falling away. "Squadron Zero and all its assigned personnel have agreed to operate in direct regard not only to King Tauri and King Tecarus, but to dragonkind and gryphons alike; as such, we are required to heed their expectations and requests. This mutual understanding and participatory cooperation has been formally recognized by the Poromish as the Scalefeather Exchange; King Tauri received the missive regarding this agreement at the beginning of last week."

Violet's head tilts so far to the side Dain thinks her ear might brush her shoulder; Brennan looks as though he might pass out; Mira looks satisfied; and Ulices Ferris seems one breath from a sick fit of laughter.

<i>"Scalefeather Exchange?"</i> the Aretian General barks. "I am unfamiliar; please explain in greater detail."

He gives the General his undivided attention; they had grown considerably more familiar since Dain recovered enough to walk and eat unaided. Though, the only common ground was a shared contempt for his father and a mounting disgust for Basgiath, Navarre, and most things tied to the two.

Still, a mutually shared hatred was enough to bring opposing sides closer than their most trusted allies. Dain also knew he held additional favor with the old man ever since Cath pranced across the war college like a flower field.

Noid howls, "So now you have to go through Navarre, Poromiel, and dragons and gryphons?"

He slaps his thigh.

"You all really want to make this as difficult as possible to get anything done?"

"I think you may be misunderstanding the circumstances, Councilor," Kingston offers.

"No." Noid shrugs. "Missions are agreed upon between the two kings, and now—"

Kingston stops him, "Squadron Zero is directly obligated to obey the reasonable requests of our bonds. Unless you'd like to argue otherwise. With gryphons. And dragons."

"I'm sorry? Your <i>bonds</i> only?"

"The Aretian Empyrean and both Southern and Northern Zeniths have agreed to provide support where, when, and as needed to ensure the survivability and protection of both hatching grounds and brood roosts. In light of this, participation in the survey is a requirement made by both Zeniths and the Empyrean," Dain explains further, eager to clear any misconception that he was using his dragon as the upper hand.

“Additionally, the Aretian Reds report losing an ancestral hatching ground near the Dunness River past Breavick and would like to analyze the conditions themselves; it will be determined whether it is safe, and how far into the Barrens they are willing to guide us.”

Noid’s lips tremble.

“Coincidentally, your dragon happens to be one of those Reds, doesn't it?” he hisses,

Dain meets his eyes with an indifferent stare that makes the old man shake, "<i>He</i> is, conveniently."

When he corrects the advisor Violet grins.

"Fine. So you get a winged funeral procession. Enjoy that." Noid turns his nose up at Dain and refuses to look in his direction, "For the record, a Navarrian liaison has yet to be appointed; Their Majesties have deferred the matter repeatedly. King Tauri is not a rider and cannot speak to rider command with the same clarity as King Tecarus, who flies; today was designated for a final decision.”

Amaryllis waves at her peer dismissively, "Zenith?"

Ulices scoffs, "Gryphon equivalent to an Empyrean, please keep up."

Gale snorts when the Councilors all glare at Ferris.

"You have the support of two... Zeniths, yet only one Empyrean? Shouldn't these things be synonymous?" Amaryllis suggests.

Dain nearly laughs.

"I have no reason to seek the approval of the Navarrian Empyrean. Cath has the weight to operate as he sees fit with the heed of dragonkind where needed.”

"<i>Cath</i> trampled over five dozen of your peers."

Bile rises in the back of Dain's throat and rinses against his mouth in grief and guilt,

"And," he grates, chin lifting,  "trust he would trample over more for <i>less</i> if he's crossed again."

His threat is fully loaded and loud, leaving Ulices Ferris giggling in his seat and Violet's eyes bouncing around in their sockets as she digests the onslaught of information he'd just given.

She's used to flaccid placation from Dain in the face of his superiors.

He remembered being that weakling, that pathetic creature who would bend and break at her disapproval, who would contort himself into whatever form she expected. He was pathetic. Spineless. But Violet's opinion no longer registered; she could stare all she wanted, could process whatever version of him she needed to process. It wasn't his concern anymore.

His life didn't need to revolve around her and whatever aspirations she held, and this version of himself was entirely of brand to her.

Their stares connect, then his shifts elsewhere.

"And the liaison?"

Dain sighs, "You sound like you have a suggestion."

"Have you reviewed these plans with your father by any chance, Lieutenant Aetos?"

Dain's eyes snap to the third Councilor who hadn't uttered a word since he'd entered the chamber; and shame, Dain thinks, that he's chosen such and abrasive approach now that he's finally spoke.

This is all rather boring without his scathing commentary.

<i>"Who?"</i> Dain chirps, bristling in response, not at his question but at the chance that Cath might be present and listening,

"Cares." Gale spits, literally—after Radomirka drops her fist that slams into his crotch.

"Your father," the old man pauses, rolling his clouded eyes when Gale yelps in response, 

"General of Basgiath, Alloces Aetos?"

Dain's sight wanders to the small windows above the gallery then back down to the Councilor, "Advisor... Vance? Right?"

"Yes, Lieutenant." he grumbles,

"I have no father. I represent no house."

Dain gazes absentmindedly at Vance.

This was bound to happen eventually

He blinks back, clearly surprised and not willing to mask it.

"Surely not," he suggests, clearing his hanging throat, "Aetos is a house rising in nobility."

"What does that matter to me? It could be a surname." Dain ponders, ignoring Sven’s snickering.

Vance lifts his chin and rubs his palm against the column of his neck.

"Lieutenant Aetos, there is only a single rider within the Squadron who is representative of Navarre and—"

"Incorrect," Dain's eyes narrow, "all riders hail from Navarrian provinces regardless of the Riot they operate within. Everything west of the wards are all ruled by His Highness King Tauri and therefore, <i>represent Navarre.</i> Unless you're suggesting Tyrrendor has entirely gained its independence?"

Sven leans back against the wall where the rest of the squadron's fliers have gathered and the rest break their bearing, adopting a relaxed formation. 

Dain can recognize his voice by the thick and weighted Poromish accent, 

"Oh, that's grand." He lulls, "Aretia has its own wards, open borders to the Poromish, and is officially participating in trade with the Isles once more, seems like Navarre isn't needed."

Drake speaks and their attention shifts across the chamber, “And the new schoolhouse.”

Vance's focus pivots to Sven behind Dain,

"Do not speak boy, you weren't asked to."

Sven's gift flares between the fourteen of them; it's similar to Catriona's in the sense that it utilizes human emotion, but Sven's gift broadcasts his own, whereas Catriona's amplifies what the target is already feeling.

"Sven."

Dain jerks his head to the assembly chamber entrance and the flier wastes no time striding through it and slamming the doors behind himself.

The impact makes a few of those observing in the gallery above jump.

"What are you getting at, your excellency?" Dain presses, eager to be done with all of this.

Eager to see Sloane.

"King Tauri requires a Navarrian liaison to oversee Squadron Zero's operations moving forward," Vance announces, his tone deceptively mild,

"Someone with military experience, political acumen, and... intimate knowledge of rider command structure."

Dain holds his breath.

He knows where this is going.

"General Alloces Aetos would be the natural choice. Your father has decades of—"

The name hits like a blow to the chest, and Dain forces his breathing to stay even. Broken fingers, fractured clavicle, welted flesh. Memories surface: his father’s fists, the lies that passed for love, suffocating embraces. His nails bite into his palms as he keeps his face still, and he slowly pulls his seat out from beneath the chamber table, sinking into it leisurely. Next to him Kingston does the same, and the rest of their fliers break away into seats further down the table except for Radomirka who stays directly behind him.

His eyes lock with Don's; her fucking gift, she can feel him panicking.

The memories come unbidden: broken fingers, broken bones, broken trust. Dain keeps his expression steady while the old pain flares. His chest constricts; could this actually happen?

"No."

The word cracks through the chamber like a whip, hitting him just as hard as it hits the room.

Vance's smile is thin, reptilian. 

"Lieutenant, this isn't a request for your approval. The General has expressed interest in ensuring the squadron's... proper oversight. Given your familial connection, communication would be seamless."

"I said no." Dain's fingers dig into sides of his chair hard enough that one of his fingernails break,

“I have no family. Only a dragon.”

"Your personal feelings toward your father are irrelevant—"

"Squadron Zero operates under <i>joint</i> command. Not Navarrian oversight. Not my father."

Drake whistles.

He feels Gale again, probably because Don presses him to through her own inferences, and his panic is bent into a sickly rage—Dain lets it consume him. Dain presses his nails into his palms to keep from jumping across the table and removing Vance’s head from his neck.

He'd rather lose himself to mindless rage than yield to fear.

"But Lieutenant," Vance leans forward, venom dripping from every syllable, "here you stand, representing Navarre's interests in a unit that is <i>half</i> Navarrian funded, wearing Navarrian rank, following orders that ultimately flow from King Tauri himself. Or have <i>you</i> forgotten where your loyalties should lie?"

Heat floods Dain's face. "My loyalties are to the eradication of venin. Not to—"

"Not to your king? How fascinating." Vance's eyes glitter. "General Aetos has already been briefed on the possibility. He's quite eager to reconnect with his son. To work together toward a common goal."

Heat surges up Dain's throat. His father. Overseeing every mission. Every decision. Every breath.

"Over my dead body." He hisses, spitting the words at him as if they might sink into the old fuck like daggers, praying to Malik they'll make him bleed,

"That can be arranged," Vance says softly, and the threat hangs in the air like smoke.

The gallery above goes deathly silent.

Brennan's chair scrapes back but Violet's hand shoots out to stop him.

"You're suggesting," Dain's voice drops to something deadly quiet, "that Squadron Zero—a jointly-obligated command with allegiance from both an Empyrean and two Zeniths—should operate under the situational authority of a General who has never flown to fight venin a day in his life? Who sends cadets to die for his political advancement?"

"I'm suggesting that unruly children need proper <i>guidance</i>—"

"Choose your next words carefully, Councilor." Dain demands.

Vance doesn't even flinch. "The decision has already been made. General Aetos departs for Aretia within the fortnight to assume his new role. King Tauri has signed the order."

The room tilts with Dain at the edge of it.

"You're <i>lying</i>."

"I assure you, I am not." 

Vance pulls a folded parchment from his jacket, the King's seal visible even from across the chamber. "Your father was quite moved by the opportunity. He mentioned it would be a chance to... repair certain familial mishaps."

Dain's vision tunnels. Every muscle in his body coils tight, ready to snap.

"He has no authority over—"

"He has <i>every</i> authority. Unless you'd like to challenge your King's direct order?" Vance's smile sharpens, "That would be treason, Lieutenant. And we all know what happens to traitors."

Radomirka's hand moves to her sword. Kingston shifts his weight in his seat. In the gallery above, every single rider in Squadron Zero goes still, now huddled around the opening.

"The General is uniquely qualified," Vance continues, savoring each word like wine. "He understands how to manage difficult subordinates. How to ensure compliance. And should the squadron prove too headstrong to accept proper leadership, well, riders can be reassigned. Fliers can be—"

<i>"Enough."</i>

Cath's aggravation crashes through the bond like a breaking dam, a tidal wave of unprecedented wrath that ravages into Dain's own and doesn't stop. Cath's fury is raw and unbottled, a primal force that recognizes the scent of a predator threatening its bonded and responds with unwavering intensity. Their rages fuse until Dain cannot tell where his ends and Cath's begins, a single conflagration burning through every nerve and synapse, turning his mind into an inferno of protectiveness so absolute it feels like an absolute, unarguable truth.

<i>"Codagh."</i> 

The Red's voice rips through their wasteland, each syllable carrying his weight. Dain's vision fractures under the force of it, his own anger still amplified by Cath's until the name barely registers through the tempest of their merged emotions.

<i>"Tell them."</i>

Dain's heartbeat slows. His vision clears, then power settles over him like armor.

"No." He says it simply. Finally. 

Vance's expression twists. "You don't have a choice—"

"Codagh has already made his preference known."

The atmosphere in the chamber becomes heavy,

"The Navarrian Empyrean?" Amaryllis leans forward, her whimsy gone.

"Codagh and Cath have an understanding." Dain's voice steadies, strengthening with every word, “If King Tauri requires a Navarrian liaison for Squadron Zero, there is only one acceptable option."

"You expect me to believe—"

"General Augustine Melgren."

Vance's face goes purple. "Absolutely not! The order has been—"

"Melgren commands respect from both Navarrian and Aretian forces as General of Navarre. His signet provides strategic advantage no other officer possesses. He has killed venin. He trains riders who kill venin." Dain's gaze locks onto Vance, unblinking. "And Codagh has made his position <i>clear.</i> Melgren or no one."

"You're using the Empyrean to avoid your father's oversight—"

"Then ask Codagh yourself." Dain tilts his head. "I'm certain Cath would be more than happy to facilitate a... conversation. Should I summon him? He's just outside."

The threat is delivered like a blacksmith's hammer, spreading heated shrapnel through the air and cutting into the other advisors alike.

Vance's throat works. His hands tremble against the table.

"You wouldn't dare."

"Try me."

Amaryllis rises slowly from her seat, her watery eyes fixed on Dain with something that might be respect.

"If <i>our</i> Empyrean has truly made their preference known, then we have no choice but to honor it." Her voice floats against the chamber's tension. Under joint command, Empyrean preference supersedes administrative appointment,

"I reject Advisor Vance's proposal pending confirmation with General Melgren's willingness to serve as liaison. He and King Tauri are well acquainted; I see no issue here. General Melgren has nothing outside of Navarre's wellbeing in his foresight." 

Dain offers her a single nod; she'd made her worship of dragons and their power known when he'd first met her. She hadn't been dismissive of Noid's suggesting Cath's diamond anything besides what it was like Vance had been either. To her, a dragon’s will was a human’s glory.

"Seconded," Ulices Ferris says immediately, his grin sharp and satisfied, "Speak now if you must; there are other things I'm sure that we all must attend to."

Vance opens his mouth—then closes it. He looks at the parchment in his hand, at Dain, at the riders watching from above, then he folds the parchment and tucks it away.

"On behalf of King Tecarus and Poromish drifts, I'm formally requesting a change in designated representatives. Current arrangements may present an inadvertent conflict with existing diplomatic engagements."

It's now Syrena who speaks over both of them, and Dain's head swivels to her seat,

"You've now openly disregarded the objective of Squadron Zero, and therefore Poromish citizens alike." she declares, pulling strands of dark black hair behind her ears, "You have also threatened the rider who has brought together both Empyreans and Zeniths in the name of mankind and inadvertently alienated himself to his own on our behalf. I see now that your interests lie in personal corners, rather than all of us as they do for Lieutenant Aetos."

She doesn't wait for a response, or even an acknowledgement to her demand, Syrena simply takes her leave with Drake and Kingston at her heels, after patting Dain's shoulder,

“We will do for you what we can, whenever we can.” She tells him in silky Krovlish.

General Ferris stands, "The General of Basgiath needs to stay within his campus like a good little cadet; he's not welcome in any Aretian establishments in light of the treatment of his son. I see now that Navarre has no plan to hold him responsible, nor to receive testimony explaining his brutish crimes, whereas I'm almost certain our Duchess will."

Violet, who's remained quiet and observant of the conversation, following its speakers with hazel eyes and stoic facial expressions, only listens intently. She allows herself to meet Dain's gaze as he watches her and her poker face falters, shattering into hurt and empathy. Dain turns away, not willing to consider what might have her reacting in such a way as one of the other advisors begin to speak.

Amaryllis nods, "This meeting is adjourned, Councilor Vance will be removed from his position as a direct representative, and we will honor the requests regarding Lieutenant Aetos. In exchange do not allow this to corrupt what's been so tediously organized. I was not aware of any of the arrangements established today and this <i>will not</i> happen in such a way again. I expect all information properly compiled and presented appropriately, and not to gain leverage. Especially that pertaining to dragons and gryphons. We cannot win this war without them."

Her last command is said with her eyes locked onto Dain's and Cath settles, his rage escaping into their wasteland winds as the chamber slowly empties.

---

For all of Amari's creations, Dain can't figure out why every person is so insistent on talking after the time to talk has well passed.

He's rushing to see Sloane, expertly filing through his unit and using them as a shield successfully when he's stopped on the staircase by the Duchess herself.

"I just need a moment, are you okay?"

Dain wipes at his Cupid's bow with the back of his hand, "I'm fine."

<i>"Walk away, you needn't this irritant."</i>

<i>"We're getting better, it's fine."</i> Dain presses at Cath with the bond; his emotions towards Violet had been churning and volatile up until his father's assault, but now he understood them better. His head drops downwards to meet her widened eyes,

"Yeah, just want to be alone for a bit."

"Can I ask you something? I mean we can talk later but I just—"

<i>"I do not care for Tairneanach and Andarna's Sickly One. She only comes to you at her convenience."</i> Cath grumbles hotly, pressing back at his bonded just as hard.

Dain doesn't entertain Cath's commentary: Violet could do whatever she wanted, he owed her that much.

"It's fine Vi, go ahead."

By now, he thinks as words trickle from Violet until they eventually press together and form a stream of spoken consciousness; Sloane ought to be cleaning up if Rhi is finished with her; maybe he'll catch her getting dressed, or maybe she'll be in the shower.

Either way his mouth waters.

Violet demands information: about his dealings with King Tecarus through Syrena and Drake, about his communicating with the gryphons and their acceptance of him, about his choice of words, the semantics behind eradicating venin rather than treating them. He placates her with time to discuss everything later, in Riorson House's library and not his suite like she suggests. 

For some reason the thought of having Violet where he'd rather have Sloane is uncomfortable to him.

Pressure tightens his throat as he rips open his suite door. Nothing's changed except the number of sparring gear sets he'd folded beneath Sloane's uniforms; there had been three, now there are two. She'd been back in his room, showered—his bathing chamber is warm and smells like the soft floral soap he'd retrieved from her room for her—and gone off to where?

He flinches when someone slams against the door.

It's Brennan.

"I <i>know</i> you're in there." He whines, "Make sure you come see me tonight so I can take a look at you; I don't have time to argue with you about it right now."

Dain holds his breath until the oldest Sorrengail's disgruntled mumbling fades down the hall.

<i>"Hatchling."</i> Cath bites, annoyance primed and flooding their bond,

<i>"Yes Cath?"</i>

<i>"Eyes. Now."</i>

He's standing just before the suite door when Cath reminds him of his appointment and Dain can't stop the heaving groan that rips from his throat; it's only her second day of Solstice and it feels like every second he can't see her makes the day hurdle towards the next. He'll blink and they'll be cities apart for months on end far too soon.

Dain's sure this eagerness is mutual too, it has to be. She was desperate for him last night—to see him, and feel him, to know him. He swears he could sense it, he could feel her yearning for him, through the stars exploding across his vision every single time he plunged into her, she was taking pieces of him for herself. And this morning, while he was shuffling into his clothes, she panicked at him not being there after only being awake for mere seconds and he watched in so much surprise he'd convinced himself that he felt that same panic.

He'd felt it so much he shook the same way she had.

<i>"Hatchling!"</i>

<i>"Moving."</i>

On his way to the courtyard he's forced into conversation with General Ferris. He's speaking with Professors Kiondra and Devera and notices Dain from the corner of his eye then abruptly steps away from his conversation to intercept the Lieutenant after Dain's nearly brushed past him in the Great Hall when the old man's hand wraps around his wrist,

"Aetos."

"General."

Dain snatches his wrist away before the General's memories can seep into his mind.

Ferris only tilts his head a bit, though his facial expression suggests disappointment, "You don't get tired of being called that?"

Dain shrugs, "It's my name, Sir."

Ferris releases him to cross his arms, "It doesn't have to be is what I'm getting at. You seem like you're in a rush—" his mouth hangs open and his eyes bulge, "—tell your dragon to leave Fann alone, I'm not planning to hold you up too long."

<i>"Every second is one wasted, you must go immediately."</i> Cath barks in response.

"He heard you." is all Dain offers the Aretian General.

"Look—" Ferris sighs, "It's a waste."

The older man's eyes flick about the hall, tracking fliers and staff as they shuffle past the two riders.

Dain's brows pop upwards, "What is?"

"You, to your father. You can't imagine the amount of eyes that've been on you. How much you've managed to adapt considering your circumstances."

"Is this supposed to be reassuring?" he scowls, confused.

"Lineage needn't be determined by blood alone; legitimacy can be granted by those who recognize value."

Dain's eyes cut to his left, then his right, "I'm not sure what that has to do with me, General."

Ferris's expression hardens. "I watched that bastard Vance weaponize your name in there. Watched you have to defend your right to exist outside your father's word. That shouldn't be your reality."

"It's always been my reality."

"It doesn't have to be." Ferris takes a step closer, voice dropping, eyes suspicious of the riders passing. "You think I don't recognize what you've quietly built? A jointly-obligated command with allegiance from both Empyreans and Zeniths? At twenty-one? That's not just performance, Aetos. That's vision."

He presses his index finger into Dain's chest, "Using one unstoppable force to break through an immovable object?"

Dain's jaw tightens. "Flattery doesn't suit you, Sir."

"It's not flattery if it's tactical assessment." Ferris crosses his arms. "You're wasted on Navarre. They'll never let you be more than Alloces' son, the one they can't control. In Aretia you could be someone else entirely." 

He pauses, watching the cogs turn in Dain's head, 

"You become nearly untouchable; you gain more room to <i>do</i>. High House of Ferris isn't just me, it's three decades of sharpened, war-fighting, humanitarian effort. I am not just an Aretian General, and you would no longer be simply Dain Aetos. Consider shedding the remnants of what you hate so much, Aetos—"

"I'm sorry," Dain laughs, loudly, and runs his hand across the bottom of his jaw, pressing gently against the scar that keeps hair from growing there, "are you suggesting adopting me into Aretian Nobility?"

"If we can have Navarrian Duchess, a Sorrengail at that, I don't see the issue. Think of it as being granted a title."

It doesn't make sense.

Maybe it does?

A young rider gained into a household with only its head to carry on its name and lineage since Ulices was well past his prime made enough sense, and wasn't unusual; but to offer this immediately following Vance's attempt to usurp Squadron's ability to remain entirely neutral with his father? The idea that Ferris would do it to snub Navarre was weightless; he'd aligned himself with fliers more than riders as of late, began plotting directly with gryphons, and literally destroyed part of their precious war college. His exchange of Wingleader to Flightleader for many was another disrespect, not to mention splitting the quadrant was his first great sin in the eyes of Navarrian loyalists.

Ferris clears his throat, "Stop thinking so much, you don't need to figure out everything on your own. I see myself in you, and you aren't the issue we thought you'd be, so let me help you. You need legitimate standing of your own."

He steps away towards the dining hall,

"Find me once you're ready to talk about it. And take Goose since you can't fly, she's the dapple grey mare."

---

Sloane's waiting just outside the ophthalmic clinic when Dain arrives on Goose's back. He dismounts so quickly that he feels every millisecond of it in each of his stitches,

"Okay, slow down maybe?"

Dain turns away from her, teeth grit with his forehead wrinkled against Goose's shoulder, fucking Gods and all their glory this woman is beautiful.

She's in her sparring gear, leathers fitted to every curve with a <i>Y</i> harness strapped asymmetrically across her back holding her massive glaive at an angle like it weighs nothing at all. It's odd that she'd be armed like this with only her wing here, with only Aretian veterans and officers everywhere, but he appreciates her preparedness, her refusal to be anything less than ready. Dain eyes the twin daggers sheathed against her hips underneath the flared waist of her leather jerkin,

"Who is this?" Sloane steps closer, reaching up to stroke Goose's muzzle, and the mare leans into her touch immediately.

He watches Sloane's fingers work against Goose's grey coat with effortless ease and his mind drifts stupidly to the two other gifts still tucked away in his quarters. Terrible timing to think about it now but she's right there, smiling at a horse, and he can't seem to think about anything else.

"Goose, Ferris's horse," he peeks down at her, "how'd you know I was here?"

"Lizards."

A smile shatters his practiced demeanor, "Careful, Cath hates being called that."

When their eyes meet amusement races through him and Sloane grins even harder than him, "Oh I know it."

That overbearing amusement swells again, sharp and bright, and Dain blinks because it doesn't quite feel like his own—but it's shared. Maybe it's Cath? He's been off for a while now. It's there in his chest but it's distant somehow, like an echo of something else. He must look confused because Sloane's smile shifts slightly, something knowing flickering across her face before she's already brushing past him towards the clinic entrance,

"Since when do Generals lend out their mounts?" she chides, waggling a golden-brown brow at him.

His eyes narrow at the blonde, and he swings an arm over her head, grabbing the door and forcing her inside before him with his hip.

"I was going to be late, so he lent her out to me. She's a very nice lady, unlike her owner."

Sloane awards him a giggle that makes his ears tingle.

Inside, glass-fronted cases throw back pale reflections; brass calipers and lens gauges rest in velvet-lined trays; the air carries alcohol and clove from polishing pastes. Fine machinery hums somewhere behind the counter, where a thin, precise wire sings. A single receptionist waits with a smile, a clerk on standby with patients' lenses to be cut after frame selection, and Dain watches Sloane's touch and swing to every display case of metal spectacles. The floor is a kind of polished stone that the heels of their boots click across as they walk.

"So, glasses? Is this your final evolution into true scholarly oblivion?" she cranes her head down as they pass the cases and her head only swivels forward to catch the next in passing; his strides are two of hers so he slows down so she can peek all she wants,

"Reading at night has always been difficult for me, and since my father attacked me it's near impossible, straining only makes it worse and gives me a headache."

"Then you'll only wear these when you're reading?"

"Right," when they reach the receptionist's desk Sloane leans over to read paperwork as Dain signs it,

"Doctor Howdershell is out and can't provide the diagnosis of your ophthalmic prescription verbally," the receptionist begins, "so she's written up an explanation for you and started you on a vitamin to help with your corneal health."

She hands him his medicinal directive written on linen like parchment and a small, velvet bundle tied with a ribbon,

"Once a week, for the next month, and we'll see you for a follow up then, Sir Aetos."

He winces; he's heard his surname enough today for the rest of the year, "Just Dain is fine."

The receptionist, Freya, only smiles professionally, "Of course," she gestures to the clinic storefront, 

"Additionally, since your doctor is out for your scheduled follow-up we've awarded you a free pair on the clinic as compensation for the inconvenience. When you've made your selection you can bring them to the front and we'll get your lenses sized, cut, and fitted for you to take today."

"Thank you."

He looks down at Sloane, "Lead the way."

"Huh? You want me to pick your glasses?" she grins,

"Yeah," he tries pointlessly to stop the long rush of breath that flees from his lungs through his teeth, but decompression hits fast and overdue.

Sloane takes his hand and pulls him off to the side of the receptionist's desk,

"What's wrong? And before you say nothing, remember what you asked from me this morning." She taps the tips of his boot with hers, "You look tired and it's only almost noon."

Dain chews his lip; smart girl never forgot a word that left anyone's mouth and always made them eat them after when she needed to.

"Tired of hearing my surname. Tired of meeting Navarrian royal affiliates instead of military officials." he takes a moment to sigh again, "Tired of being puppeteered by my father in every corner I escape into."

She leads him to a display case of thin, artfully crafted frames on the left side of the store, "Did that happen during the ad hoc meeting?"

"Yes."

"And Basgiath still hasn't made him give a statement or explanation?"

He almost sneers but washes it down in light of her concern for him when her eyes finally dip away to bounce from frame to frame. 

It's not Sloane's fault that she's completely unaware of how sloppy and unaccountable Navarrians with any sort of authority were; for Dunne's sake, their own King hadn't realized his son was right under his nose for more than half a year.

The last thing anyone would make Alloces Aetos do would be upholding the very same values he claimed to instill in cadets; there was no honesty, and certainly no integrity.

"I'll never get one Sloane, that's not how any of this works."

Sloane's face twists to his as the last of his statement weakly parts from his lips, "I didn't ask if that's how things work, Dain, I asked if you hadn't received an apology." Her voice cracks through the store like a stone through glass, "And you will get one if it's the last thing I hear from that wretched fucking rat."

Her words stop him cold. 

Wretched is the exact descriptor Cath uses, spat with the same contemptuous weight anytime his dragon speaks of his father. 

And now here it is, falling from Sloane's lips with that same vicious edge.

He compares them for a split second: Sloane and Cath. Her aggression is royal and red, that same savage temper his swordtail carries. She stands there looking like she'd burn the world down for an apology he'll never receive, fists clenched, eyes blazing the blue of flames that burn the hottest; that searing, white-hot blue that consumes everything in its path.

Two beings in his life now who defend him with the same ferocity, who call his father by the same damning noun. It's coincidental—anyone with sense would call Alloces wretched, but the similarity still strikes something warm and aching in his chest.

What did he do to deserve this? A dragon who'd level cities for him, and now a woman speaking with that same protective venom?

Nothing, he's done <i>nothing</i> to earn either of them, Sloane in particular.

But she is, vengeance incarnate, defending him like he's worth the trouble.

Like he never took the last thing deserving of this protectiveness away from her.

"I don't want revenge. I just want to be left alone." he admits quietly.

Her eyes flare, "I said an apology, not revenge; now try these on,"

Sloane's first choice makes him pause before reaching for it; they're frameless and mounted onto the hardware that's brass-finished with fine screws through artisan engravements that bring the look together,

"These... are a bit off-brand for me aren't they?" he gapes, glancing over at her with the frail spectacles in hand.

"You look slutty in them. I like it," she hums while looking him dead in the eyes.

His mouth falls open.

<i>Slutty?</i>

Of all the ways Dain Aetos had ever been perceived, <i>slutty</i> had never been one of those things.

The idea alone shakes whatever braincells are left working after that Gods-awful meeting and he feels the glasses sliding onto his face before he thinks to put them on; if she wanted him slutty he could be slutty, he thinks. Though, when he glances at himself in the small mirror provided with the display of frames, he hardly notices them at first glance until the brass catches the sunlight spilling through the clinic windows,

"I think that's our first contender."

He watches as her expression softens, her quiet contentedness in being right about a pair of glasses eases away her irritation, 

"So how long do I get to do this?"

Now she's giddy, and impending doom of not being able to sit down makes the wounds littering his torso ache. Typically Cath would've had a snide comment about his lack of self preservation, but their bond is silent.

"I'll only try on ten." he declares.

Twenty five later, she's picked his two.

Dain returns Goose to a red-faced Ulices Ferris when they arrive back at the fortress; he looks at Dain, then drags his eyes over Sloane and the two of them watch expressions flit across his face that neither of them can name. Dain thinks he recalls one, that ghastly look of surprise the Aretian General gives whenever he discovers he's right about something.

Sloane misses it, or ignores it, and turns to him in the courtyard as Thoirt circles from above,

"He lends you his horse and waits for you to come back with her?"

"I think, he thinks, he likes me." Dain mutters as Ferris leads Goose back to the stables, "But I also think he's not all there."

"He seems lucid to me. Maybe he does like you?" Sloane rambles, eyes on Thoirt.

Dain exhales slowly, the sound heavy with disbelief, "That would be weird; he made sure I was locked in a room for seventy-two hours right after I split the quadrant."

"How's he been lately?" Sloane presses, eyes following Thoirt's fluid motions as she bends in for a landing and they both pull their flight goggles up. Sloane waves her hands in warning to the others around them so there's time enough to establish a proper safe zone.

She'd probably be embarrassed to know that her procedural compliance makes him a bit hard.

"He checked on me a lot when I couldn't speak. Made sure he was always around during my physical therapy..." Dain feels shoulders rise and fall in a defeated motion; he's already mentally catalogued this moment and filed it away under 'things that don't matter,'

"He offered to adopt me into High House Ferris too. So I'd have a title."

Sloane's attention pans to Dain entirely as Thoirt's massive body drops to the courtyard, "Really?" she squeaks, "Swear!"

"On my life." He barks over her daggertail's flapping wings.

Sloane's mouth opens, closes, opens again; she looks like she wants to say something, ask something, but the moment hangs suspended between them until Thoirt's massive head swings around,

"She wants to see your glasses!"

Dain turns away from Sloane to stare at Thoirt.

This is a prank.

His mind swims; Cath had chosen his haircut so would it be so odd that another dragon might choose his glasses?

He reaches for Cath, but again, there's only him.

<i>"Where are you?"</i>

Ahead of them Thoirt finally settles, wings folding inwards as her talons spread across the cobblestone floor.

"Thoirt wants to see my glasses?"

"Well, no, she wants to see what <i>I</i> picked for you."

"She didn't see it in the clinic?" Dain suggests; the tone of his voice tells the tale that he certainly doesn't believe a dragon cares at all what sits on his face at night.

"She was talking to Cath before he left, so she didn't see all of them."

Left for where?

<i>"Cath?"</i>

The question nearly escapes and he bites his tongue in practice of self preservation when Thoirt's neck rotates downwards to perceive him in his place at the base of the courtyard's chiseled stone.

He hadn't heard from Cath since leaving Riorson House.

"She wants to see the first pair, Dain."

He nods, reaching into his pockets for the glasses cases then pulling the first open and hesitantly speaking to Sloane's Red, "...well Sloane liked these ones the most."

Thoirt's head lowers and Dain is blinded by her twinkling eyes; they aren't that marigold that Cath beholds upon him. Thoirt's eyes are more... like foiled gold, metallic in every sense of the word, twinkling, glittering even. If he could price dragons based on looks alone, Thoirt would surely go to the highest bidder. She bore no tears, or rips, or scars along her scales that were all perfect shades of Dessert Dreams, a native Navarrian pepper found in the northernmost peaks of Luceras, seated high and hidden in its full bushes and bearing an insidious heat. Named that way in the irony of being found only in the most barren, snowy expanses, and often inducing panic, and hallucinations when digested by those lost and close to death who've come across it.

He'd seen these red peppers once during a flight with Cath to a Northern post earlier last year and hadn't forgotten them since. Thoirt was their embodiment in every way; untouchable, and unreachable. Dain had only ever witnessed Cath struggle to keep up with one other dragon and it had been Sgaeyl until Thoirt and Sloane had put them in their place soaring directly into and through a storm——almost leaving them behind and bruising Cath's ego so badly he'd become intolerable whenever Dain had recollected the flight at all for a whole week.

Maybe that's why he can't find a single blemish on Thoirt while facing her.

She's simply untouchable.

And she chose Sloane, what a perfect match made in Amari's great creation.

<i>"When you're done admiring me I'd quite like to see the next pair of spectacles."</i>

"Oh, right. Sorry about that."

He puts the pair Sloane fiendishly described as <i>slutty</i> back in its case and pockets it, then switches to the other, a full-rimmed pair.

<i>"Shame. I liked the round ones. You should return to acquire them."</i>

"Oh, I liked those ones too." He says back to her—

<i>—wait.</i>

That's not Sloane.

"Why didn't you say anything while we were in the clinic?" Sloane groans, "Now I feel bad."

The glasses case hits the cobblestone floor with a light thud.

<i>"Shame."</i> the other voice in his mind says again, and fleeting disappointment settles over his senses.

Dain's entire body leans forward, this disappointment—it's not his, and that feminine voice, it's not Sloane's.

Thoirt's gargantuan chin jerks upwards in the same motion Sloane makes when she's being a little smart-ass.

<i>"I suppose you have questions, Minnow?"</i>

Dain flounders about in his mind, pulling at the pathways there: he sees his and Cath's wasteland, and two more from one of which, the stranger's velvet voice jingles like mastercrafted bells.

<i>"Minnow?"</i> he calls back into the twinkling blue mist where it came from,

<i>"Would you prefer Hatchling?"</i>

Heat streaks across his face, <i>"No ma'am."</i>

Thoirt's wings arch upward, blazing red in the late afternoon sky, "I'd like to wake up now." Dain chuckles, blinking rapidly at Sloane, who seems as if this is no surprise to her, and Thoirt, who is utterly unbothered.

<i>"I'm afraid dreams don't get any more pleasant than this, Minnow."</i>

Dain blanches.

Surely Cath would've told him he had a mate. And that it was Thoirt.

And even as panic gathers, he recognizes foreign emotion in the bond—Thoirt's own emotion had been slipping through a door she'd left cracked open for him to find.

Pain settles in his chest like a stone dropped into still water, and then the ripples begin; what if Cath hadn't told him because he wasn't worth telling? If his dragon had recognized something fundamentally unworthy in him, something that made him unfit to know such sacred truth? Dragon mating bonds were for life, were everything; they were the most permanent, the most sacred thing in their world, and if Cath hadn't seen fit to share that with him, then what did that say about Dain's place in their bond? 

Was his continuity the issue? Him being fundamentally wrong? Maybe he was a danger to Thoirt in that sense.

The bond between dragon and rider was supposed to be sacred too, was supposed to be complete trust and transparency, but if Cath could keep something this monumental from him, then what did that mean? What did it mean that his own dragon, the one being who was supposed to see him clearly and completely, had deemed him unworthy of this knowledge?

Maybe he hadn't been told because it wasn't something necessary to share unless Cath wanted to; it's not like he told his Red he was courting Sloane afterall. He doesn't deserve them anyway, doesn't deserve either of them.

And it could be worse than just being unworthy. Since Sloane had been receptive of his pursuit, maybe Cath saw his only option to be Thoirt. He'd often wondered if Tairn bonded Violet because of their relationship, to keep Sgaeyl safe, but it seemed absurd at the time considering Violet hadn't been much of a threat to him initially.

He reaches for them, for Thoirt and Sloane in the wasteland and finds another pathway, hardly materialized, but he can still sense the presence of another in his—of <i>two.</i>

<i>"I'm sorry."</i> he tells them.

Ahead of him both dragon and rider shuffle, Sloane stepping in his space and wrapping her arms tight around his neck, and Thoirt's face appears impossibly close; he'd only ever been this close to Dòrainn outside of Cath. Her glittering eyes and scarlet head engulf anything he might see beyond her figure.

<i>"Why would you ever be sorry?"</i> Sloane asks gently.

<i>"We don't have to communicate this way if you don't want to."</i> he declares swiftly: the last thing he wants is for either of them to feel obligated to associate with him, <i>"And we don't have to see each other just because Cath and Thoirt need to."</i>

Sloane releases him but stays planted firmly between his feet with her forehead against his chest, <i>"But I want to."</i>

<i>"What about Thoirt? Does she—"</i>

<i>"I'm quite pleased to be acquainted with two exceptional humans."</i> Thoirt snorts, <i>"Though the both of you think far too much."</i>

Dain looks up at Thoirt, then away; he can't just ask her where his swordtail is, why he wasn't informed—

<i>"My Little Love found out the same way you are now. It's what we preferred. Though he unfortunately is busy cleaning up a mess he's made within the courts."</i>

So he's been busy, Dain ponders. He wonders if it's out of place to ask Thoirt when he'll be back.

Sloane nods when he drops his head to face her, <i>"Thoirt made me tell Cath I'm Squad Leader and I guess you could say he congratulated me."</i>

For a suspended instant he can only hear the echo of her voice where it should never be, threaded through the pathway he's never known. His pulse stutters, the bond hums, and the world narrows to the impossible clarity of Sloane inside his head.

<i>"Oh."</i>

His breath catches as his eyes crawl across Thoirt's scales, lightheaded at his lover's voice beneath his skin.

"Wait," Dain pushes Sloane away by her shoulders, "Did you just say <i>Squad Leader?!</i>"

<i>Of course</i> she's a Squad Leader he preens before pressing his mouth to hers; she's the last Mairi, the singularity. Adapting, overcoming, excelling, sure her start was questionable but so was Violet's and they're both equally impressive. A grin breaks across his face as he pulls away,

"They see in you what I do." he pulls her close again, "I can't wait to witness what else you'll become."

<i>"I've been waiting all day to tell you that."</i>

Fond annoyance seeps into his shared pathway with the two, <i>"Have you?"</i>

<i>"She has. And, finally, she can stop playing in every scenario she decides to tell you in."</i> Thoirt groans; the vibration she makes deep in her chest rumbles the courtyard,

<i>"Stop being dramatic."</i> Sloane hisses, her own annoyance mixing into the bond, <i>"It's only been like three hours since I found out!"</i>

Their bond thrums, and in its wake Dain recognizes that unfamiliar brightness he’d misattributed to Cath: this amusement that wasn’t his, this contentedness that wasn’t his; it's Thoirt’s.

All day today she'd been trying to expose him to her slowly.

<i>"Three entire hours of, 'Will he tell me I've done well? Will he have expected it? Will I be rewarded a kiss—'"</i>

<i>"Okay Thoirt, you can leave now."</i> Sloane's face blisters pink, <i>"You're loitering."</i>

Thoirt presses her wings back against her body, <i>"No, I think I prefer to listen to Minnow's monologuing a bit longer."</i>

Dain beams at Thoirt's comment and pulls Sloane in close, <i>"Don't be like that Sloane,"</i> he teases, <i>"I want both my girls here whenever I can have them."</i>

<i>"Good grief; do not ever let Cathachadh hear you say that."</i>

Sloane's laughter echoes in his mind. Bright, unburdened, <i>his</i>. It's the most beautiful sound he's ever heard, and for once, Dain doesn't question whether he deserves it.
