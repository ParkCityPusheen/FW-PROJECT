Time heals, but *slowly.*

Dain recovers with it, none of it means anything—_not really_—until Cath’s dark growl combs through his mind and scrapes gently across his skin. At first, he thinks he’s dreaming it. This continues until the next morning when Dain can finally respond.

He drifts in and out of a heavy, golden sleep. Sensation hums at the edge of his mind. The world slowly returns to him piece by piece, not all at once. 

He lives many lives; as a man, as a woman, old, young, as Violet, Brennan, and Mira occasionally. He speaks with Trager in an opulent manor in one moment and in another visits ornate temples in Loysam where water runs so clear he barely notices it breaking at his ankles as he walks through their foyers. He learns of Ulices Ferris' past love—of the child they dreamt of. There are even smaller details; worry for him as he lays broken in a bed. Pity turned empathy as he recovers under the watchful eye of Red dragon who stalks the cliffside of the room he sleeps in. Concern when his health suddenly declines.

He learns he fights constant fever—an invisible fire that scorches his mind as much as his body. It nearly kills him twice on occasion.

Somewhere between memory and morning, his body catches up to his mind and soul, and gentle light bathes the wood paneling of the bedroom, coats the cream sheets he's burrowed in in the luxurious peach colors of the early morning sunrise.

*"Good morning hatchling."* Cath bellows, stirring when he feels Dain pawing at him through the wasteland, “*I wish to see you.*”

Dain manages a laugh that shakes his body and makes him wither as pain surges in response.

“*You won’t fit in this room with me, Cath.*”

The emotional yearning he reaches for Dain with nearly makes his rider weep: he wants to see Dain, to simply gaze upon him, to tell himself that his bond certainly lives and recovers.

*"Lift your head so that I may see you."* he demands,

Dain does. He rises slowly, bracing against the padded headboard, then smiles towards the glass double doors at the eastern end of the room.

“*My Knight.*” Cath calls, head jutting from the *hole in the cliffside* where he'd burrowed through it from the Red's den beneath.

Cath lulls him back to sleep with the sounds of his own shuffling and breathing. He can hear the ambience of other dragons conversing somewhere distant. The thumping of heavy, scaled feet against the rock tunnels, and knows Cath is safe and deep in his den.

Dain struggles with the screen of loneliness that encompasses his mind before fading back to unconsciousness.

---

He’s still not sure how much time has gone by now, but he can see properly. There’s still a grey vignetting around his peripheral vision but this is fine. He realizes it when he wakes up early in the morning, or maybe late at night, he can’t tell. 

He doesn’t recognize the room he’s in, but it’s certainly ornate. There’s a large sweeping, black velvet curtain that separates the bed he’s in from what he can only assume is the rest of a bedroom. He swings his head from left to right slowly, taking in the details provided they’re lit enough by the extremely dim mage lights.

His heart pumps excitedly when he sees a set of arched double-doors that open to a cobblestone terrace on an attached private balcony. Beyond the stone banister is the open expanse of Tyrrendor and Dain assumes the view is of the cliffs Riorson House has been carved into—

—where Cath's blurred head had been poking out of before.

He flicks an emotion down the bond, already fighting sleep, that same yearning Cath blazed into him… days ago?

It takes seconds for him to hear the thumping of dragon wings and even less for Cath to peer at him through the doors. He keeps himself suspended, hovering close to the cliff side. The space is enough, much farther back, that his dragon beholds him from a distance.

“*Look at you.*”

“*Look at us.*” Dain counters.

Cath beats his wings downwards so hard the whole room shakes when Dain notices he’s hovering awkwardly at an angle. 

“*Do not concern yourself with me.*” Cath warns,

Dain bristles pathetically in defiance, he barely gets the emotion swept through their wasteland’s winds.

“*Who hurt you?*”

“*It matters not. Death’s deliverance shall bear the pain done unto you.*”

Cath ascends, flicking his tail against the mountain side as he fades into the distance and part of the cliff side snaps into the depths beneath Riorson House.

His absence stirs panic—but then the bond floods with warmth, muffled voices, and the soothing cadence of den-life. Dain slips into sleep before the fear can stick.

___

They’re just above Riorson House, gathered on the central hill of the first rolling cluster within the valley. Dòrainn and Cath are sprawled wide across the slope, with Dain tucked between them like an actual hatchling. He's pressed up against the scales of Cath's cheek and the end of Dòrainn's battered snout. 

He chuckles.

Technically, they’re all sunbathing—but no matter how much warmth they soak in, there’s still a biting chill in the shifting weather.

Most days, now that he’s not bed-bound, Dain spends his time like this. Never alone—whether outside or inside. There’s always someone watching, even kindly. A team of healers shadows him constantly, and one of them, a formidably quiet girl named Nino, reads to him from the tomes of Loial’s temples while he sleeps.

She recites things like love and light. Compassion and clarity. Peace and presence, echoed through the mirrors of protection and purpose.

Now, Cath does the same.

_“You are undeserving of the strife these humans have offered you.”_

For the first time in nearly a week, Dain hears his own banter rise, crisp and instinctive. He means to respond—to reach for Cath in return—but the words choke off when he realizes he can’t. Not in the bond. Not fully.

There are still days like this when the connection is _warped_—its magic corrupted by what the poison left behind.

Sometimes, it almost makes him cry.

He turns his face deeper into Cath’s jaw, pretending not to feel the sting behind his eyes. Cath snorts a deep quake against the hill’s surface, waking Dòrainn, who lifts his head, scans the ridge and Dain, then promptly returns to snoozing.

_“They will know my wrath. They will remember my den. I will curse them, have them beg. If you will so allow it... I do not wish to see you any more distressed than you are now.”_

---

There's a routine.

His Squadron has breakfast with him; they bring him sweet, buttery baked goods and rich coffees. Several days they're banned by Nino after making him laugh so hard he struggles to breathe and has a nasty coughing fit.

When they're allowed back they still joke, much more than Nino would like by the look in her scrunched face, but they document new paradigms, and make plans to introduce even tighter flight patterns. Every second is one spent meaningfully—especially the personal, unofficial ones.

Lunch is with Catriona, Kai, Maren, Bragen, and Neve. Maren keeps him updated on the political fares between Navarre and the Poromish, while Cat speaks with him about runes and even has him practice after Brennan strictly forbids it. Bragen and Neve gossip about a secondary college being erected in Aretia for fliers and riders, while Kai just seems happy to be there, and tells him all about Basgiath.

General Melgren now acts in his father’s stead—pending permanent decision, or some hopeful, future disgrace.

It seems an odd choice to Dain, considering the General of all of Navarre's military forces would be off doing more important things. Probably increasingly sleazy things, or overlooking all of the horrendous atrocities that continue to happen on the campus grounds. 

He doesn't mull over it for too long, he'd rather think about anything else.

Violet, Mira, and Brennan fuss over him into the late night, and eyeball Cath in disbelief the first time they see his gargantuan head peeking out the cliffside,

"Tell me that's not your fucking dragon off in the distance Dain."

He looks and sees Cath in his spot, he foolishly tries to fight away the grin that breaks across his face, "That's him,"

"You two are something else." Mira guffaws through a mouthful of soup, while fighting Broccoli for it. 

She brings the orange cat with her whenever she comes by, though Broccoli normally finds his way here throughout the day anyway—Dain's suite door is always open. Regardless, familial quarter is under *strict* surveillance, there was even an armed watch outside of the entryway.

"I have some news," Violet begins after handing him a glass of water, "want it now or later?"

"Now, please. Thank you." He nods at her and she sits on the couch across from Mira and Brennan,

"Firstly, congratulations, Second Lieutenant Dain Aetos, on graduating Basgiath War College. Your wing was the first to secure both objectives in War Games and also somehow managed to thwart First Wing so badly it took them the whole two days provided to complete the evolution."

She giggles like the little, evil gremlin she is; and he can't help being infected by it.

*"Congratulations Knight—we have a gift for you."*

*"A gift?"* Dain echoes, wonder filters through him, *"What is it?"*

*"A rock."* Cath answers smugly,

Dain purses his lips, *"...okay."*

The three siblings clap, Brennan lifts a glass of unnamed liquor to the rafted ceilings.

*"I have raised excellence."* Cath declares, no doubt preening wherever he was.

Part of him wishes he could be there with his wing to graduate. To enjoy the ambience of the moment, share the smiles, but the dread of being there overwhelms him now. 

Was he still there? Still walking Basgiath’s halls like nothing happened? Still proud?

His father always flitted about so proudly during ceremonies, flaunting, grinning like a Godsdamned fool. Dain imagines he would even be proud to show his face after what he'd done to him.

He's sure no one has asked Alloces *why* he'd done what he'd done. 

He's sure there might not have been a reason at all.

Violet slurps a few more spoonfuls of her soup, "Gradation is in a week, again, and Melgren is letting Fourth Wing travel to Aretia to visit you if they want to,"

Dain blinks, "They postponed graduation?"

"Twice now." she mutters, eyes closest to a true blue he's ever seen in them.

Almost true.

Nothing as true as Sloane's though.

"He even gave them—" Mira chews on a dinner roll, "He even gave them a whole day to compensate travel."

Brennan's brows bounce, "Six day Solstice, how generous of him."

"Right," Violet adds, "Two nights after we got you here, King Tecarus sent word on behalf of Poromiel, and King Tauri sent Halden to... *delegate.*"

He taps the bottom of the desk with his boot, "I'm sure arrangements went the exact opposite way his father would've wanted them to."

"Fliers, the Prince, and the Empyrean." Mira pipes, "Imagine."

"Who was the Empyrean's representative?" Dain thinks, distracted, as he sets his glass down on his desk and grabs Broccoli, rubbing his bead against the side of the orange tabby while he purrs,

"Codagh." Brennan answers.

"Drake *and* Cat. Melgren. Halden," Mira says dryly.

Dain grimaces at the thought of Catriona and Halden attempting to have a civilized conversation and his imagination falls short of nothing less than *war.* Even more so, with Drake and her speaking with Melgren, who would happily see them both dead across the border with a smile. He wonders why Cat hadn't said anything about it.

"Sounds like a fucking shitshow." Dain shudders, "How'd that go?"

"For us, very well, for Navarre... not at all." Brennan grins.

Dain leans forward on the desk and crushes Broccoli, "Tell me."

"Tecarus wants us to make a dual enrollment college in Aretia; he's willing to *fund* it because we opened our borders." Brennan blurts, his body jerks when he says it, like he's been *waiting* for his turn to talk, as if it'd kill to wait just once more.

Dain scratches his ears.

*What?*

He watches Broccoli slip underneath both couches, smashing his whiskered face against the legs of Violet's, then crossing under the low-set serving table and back to the desk.

Brennan begins shaking his head like a deranged patient, "That's right. That's right—I still haven't even gotten to the fucking roof repairs for this damn fortress. But we need to erect a whole *college* meant for riders and fliers in less than three months." 

"Why would it be less than three months?"

"Dain, the plans were fucking drawn. The assembly pushed for it because Tecarus is not only offering to fund the damn thing, but he's also allowing us to tax him on it, and the taxes in themselves would help rebuild Aretia substantially. And I mean—"

He spreads his arms as wide as they can go.

"But how does that even—" Dain stops to gather his thoughts.

Would the school have its own Parapet? Gauntlet? Threshing? War Games? And fliers? Would they have their Cliffsbaine equivalent here if fliers are meant to attend?

His head *throbs*.

*"Knight."* Cath warns.

*"I'm fine, promise. Just..."*

He sends his worry to Cath who accepts it, then plunders him with reassurance,

"Oh yeah, doesn't seem like any of them have told you even though they hover around the second floor waiting for you to walk out all day—fliers left Basgiath the same day you were brought here and have not returned. They don't plan to until..."

Mira stops talking to shrug.

Dain raises a brow and Mira wiggles her spoon at him while griping, "Yeah. You don't know, I don't know, Vi doesn't know, Brennan doesn't know—"

"And doesn't care long as their King continues to pay room and board." Brennan groans after drinking down the remnants of his soup, then he sighs, "We've got... two hundred in house now that Cygnisen has sent theirs over, well *some* of them. Fucking feathers everywhere, all over the valleys."

Violet stretches out across the couch then bunches her hair and tosses the silver ends over the edge of it, "Speaking of Cygnisen—"

"For all Amari's creations," Dain gasps, "does this fucking *end?*"

Violet tosses her hands up, "In death."

"Pretty much." Mira adds; she's stealing Vi's unfinished soup.

"I can't wait to have you in the assembly chamber with me again." Brennan squeaks sarcastically, draining the rest of his drink and belching.

"That expedition they want to send your Squadron on is supposed to detour there, I think Drake is joining you all to present the college idea to the nobility there. Also you're meant to be the acting Ambassador while traveling; the other riders are meant to be intermediaries."

Violet finishes and drops her arms against the couch.

Mira drinks the rest of her soup.

Brennan sighs, then yawns.

Broccoli meows.

"Send me back to Basgiath." Dain moans, face down against the desk.

***"No."***

It's a sharp and quick response from all three siblings, a hiss from Broccoli, *and* Cath.

---

Brennan lifts the "time ban" three days before Basgiath's graduation ceremony; it'd been enforced the day Dain woke up—healer nor rider, civilian nor staff were allowed to tell him the time of day, the week, or month. Though, he thinks now, it hadn't been a month at all.

"Today is the twenty-seventh," he mutters while scraping through his beard with *Dain's* comb, eyes flicking between himself and the cadet, "It's officially been two weeks since the usual graduation date."

Dain stares at Brennan in the mirror while he brushes his teeth. The older continues to groan about Riorson House budgeting.

He wonders if they would cut out some of the lesson planning considering the semesters were now thrown off by a whole fourteen days, it would be the sane thing to do—to not suffocate the cadets in a heavy workload. He can't help sneering, gagging in figurative disgust as he brushes the back of his tongue.

As if *Melgren* would ease up on cadets.

"When do we graduate now?" he asks Brennan after spitting toothpaste into the marble sink,

"You have already graduated, *Sir,*" Brennan reminds him while glaring at him from the corner of his eye, then refocusing on his stubbled cheeks in the mirror.

He’d earned a title, sure. Rank, and recognition for Squadron. But it felt like receiving a medal for surviving a war no one had seen the worst of. He hadn’t earned it so much as outlasted it. His survival was mistaken for success—like being handed a ribbon for crawling out of rubble.

Dain groans, "You know what I mean Bren—my wing. And what about Vi? She said Melgren approved her pardoning from the college, is he curating her graduation requirements?"

"He is, also Carr."

Brennan pauses, then sighs, "He'll be in Aretia throughout the year for a cumulative observation of her progress as a rider. She also gets *bonus points* for participating in big evolutions and post-time."

"Midland posts?"

It's where most of the third years had been sent, so he assumes nothing has changed much yet.

"Yup—what are you even doing today?"

Dain grabs his comb from Brennan, tries to, but Brennan yanks it from his reach, "Look at your face Dain. You should cut that down, and your hair."

Dain glares at him, "You know *nimble* is something my hands can't do right now. I might slice my jugular trying."

He glances around the bathroom then adds, "I don't even have my shaving blade."

"Then go into town and un-scruff yourself." Brennan retorts, then places some gold pieces next to the sink, "I'll see you tonight; what's the rules?"

Once in the morning and once at night Brennan came to see Dain to micromanage his wounds. He'd explained his process a few days ago: lungs, heart, arms, and everything else. Lately he'd been focusing on Dain's arms and the *everything else,* mending ligaments and tendons by muscle group depending on which held the mending.

They'd spoken briefly about that as well; the un-doing of mending magic via the elixir his father has poisoned him with. Allegedly it was a type of developmental drug, similar to the one administered during RSC, but doubly as potent—maybe five-times in honesty.

Brennan seemed like he wanted to mention a few things about, but he held his tongue.

"No fighting, no flying." Dain responds breathlessly as if the conversation were sucking the life out of him, "Even though I can ride horses and wield weapons."

Brennan cuts his eyes at him from the threshold of the bathing chamber door, "Don't get smart with me, young man."

Dain narrows his eyes at him, "Yes *dad.*"

He said it like a joke, but it pulls at something quieter inside him. Not painful exactly—just unfamiliar.

*"Do not call him that.*" Cath bites while feeling the awkwardness with Dain.

Brennan raises a brow and leaves, and Dain cleans off the sink vanity after hearing the *click* of the suite door. He swipes the gold.

*"Really Cath?"*

*"You do not sass me when I have told you to do something."*

*"Don't be mean to me."* Dain remarks.

He walks the quickest his upper body allows, so almost briskly, and dresses without the help of healers. Nino and Tambling are his observers today but they remain preoccupied with reports in the sitting area after his desk. Nino's eyes chance a single maternal glance at him, she nods her head and turns back to her parchment as he slithers by.

It was brief, but it warmed something in his ribs. That old ache of being watched not to judge, but to care.

*"Do not redefine my tone with puny human objectification, Knight."*

*"But you are being mean."*

The room he's been quarantined to was now officially his. It was located at the very end of the familial quarters on the second floor of Riorson House and was also the only live-in work space in the fortress. The staff dubbed it "the suite," and the attached bedroom, "the enclave".

During his childhood, things like spacious rooms were something beneath his father to afford his son, so Dain grew cramped in small rooms not even designated as such. More often then not he'd been stuffed into miscellaneous side rooms, or even large closets the size of bathing chambers—not the one here in his suite though, the one nearly the size of the enclave. 

His rooms in Basgiath were great, he reminisces.

Until they weren't.

*"Both of you are terribly insufferable. Too old, too young."* 

Cath grumbles as Dain strips out of his sleepwear and into the civilian attire the Sorrengails had picked out for him with far too much enthusiasm. They'd packed both built-in armoires full of clothing, and it looks like Cat and her group had too when he notices Poromish clothing folded just beneath the Tyrrish garbs.

It's colder today, so he slips into pair of looser, heavy canvassed trousers and an even heavier long-sleeved blouse in a perfectly matched shade of black. He blinks at the keyhole neckline, recognizing Violet's taste in attire almost immediately and laughing; she'd always preferred him dressed up like some noble's son.

*"I think it's you. Dòrainn seems like a nice guy."*

*"Dòrainn is neither guy, nor is he nice. He is a dragon, address him as such.*"

Dain chuckles—he guesses Cath was feeling back to his normal self considering the attitude.

*"You're too big to ride into town."* he sighs absentmindedly.

*"No. Flying. No. Fighting."* Cath barks, *"Follow your prescribed regimen! You already play along boundaries training with Fann's rider."*

He spent a few moments in the sparring gyms with Ulices Ferris on more than one occasion—the Aretian General had him practice maintaining a proper stance and holding the pommel of his shortsword, maybe a few swings, not at anything or anyone. He lectured Dain on the importance of muscle memory. He griped about Navarrian politics and Violet. And sometimes he would slip up and mention Melgren, or his father, at which point Dain would pretend to be too focused in his training and quietly listen to him ramble without participating actively in conversation.

It was easier with Ferris droning on. No hovering, no doting, no questions he didn’t want to answer. Just the weight of a blade in his hand and the old man’s raspy voice filling the space.

And, though it was entirely out of spite, Dain liked that he felt strongly about condemning his father in his treatment. He felt seen somehow, that Ulices Ferris of all people wanted to know the reason for Dain's torture the most, although he would call it lacking no matter the explanation. 

"If I had a son?" Ferris had spat, face red and belly hanging, "I would have *never.* No matter the reason. This is why Navarre is quick to resolve issues in cowardice; it's in their nature, Dain, they don't even know how to treat their own blood. They will always resort to cruelty like the monsters they are."

He blinks away the memory.

Dain purses his lips, *"I have to maintain some sort of readiness Cath; I get that my recovery is important but so are the tedious politics and my readiness."*

Cath snarls.

*"I know this. Do not lecture me."*

*"Want to help me pick a haircut?"* Dain says smoothly; he seeks his swordtail's approval as a peace offering.

*"Yes. Hopefully the human sheering here is better than the foolishness in Navarre."* he spits.

Dain pulls his boots on outside on the terrace, *"You never told me you didn't like my haircut...*"

Cath is calm, his presence heavy in the wasteland.

"*I like everything about you—even when things are wrong.*"

He pauses for moment while lacing his boots, glancing up to see Cath watching him from his hidey-hole in the cliffside.

*"Do not call it a 'hidey-hole.'"*

*"But it is a hidey-hole, only your head pokes out—like a cat."*

*"I am no simple feline, hatchling. I am Cathachadh son of——"*

Yeah, Dain sighs.

They're definitely feeling better.
