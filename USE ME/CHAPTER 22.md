Aaric was painfully right—life continues after death. She’d known that, of course, but hearing it while Dain’s life hung in the balance had been a commandment. 

One that forced her rising fury to change course.

When they arrive back at Basgiath, Maiselle alone decodes the message that had been uncovered in Aretia while the rest of them work to help to free those trapped under rubble. Once the casualties were counted, Iron Squad was pulled aside—questioned by scribes, checked by healers, processed like protocol demands after any disaster.

They eat, shower, and sleep, finally, at noon. The next two days classes are canceled and all personnel are ordered to stay in their quarters unless otherwise ordered.

The whispers of Dain Aetos’s abuse echo loud in the hallways of the college—lingering like the blood still pooled on the floor of his father’s office. The rumors flicker in and out of his wing's ears as the other's arrive with oddly unfit demeanors. Sloane bites her tongue outside of the bounds of her year-mates and seniors, she trains her reactions and aggression—fits them in sheaths in her mind for daggers of emotions forged in all shapes and sizes.

She imagines herself beside him—reliable, unreadable. Not the easily rattled girl who once trailed after Dain… and before him, Liam, and Garrick, and Bohdi, and Xaden. 

This first day, after leadership knocks on every dorm door and take muster in person, and those "other" orders are given.

"...Mairi you're on site with Nolon." Her eyes flick around the dorm, "You don't have to make small talk if you don't want to, but don't be difficult."

*Normally,* she'd be offended, immediately on edge—like how Brennan's honest comment had slid under her skin and ignited her blood—but she raises her chin and simply nods. She knows Nolon has participated in the torture of both Violet and Dain, and while her molars break along the edge of her own indignation at the thought of having to be near him, she bottles it up nicely,

"Heard."

During breakfast she and Avalynn are tucked between Aaric and Baylor. They eat boiled eggs, hashed beef, and thin, Navarrian spice-breads stuffed with tangy capers and pickled brineling,

"Why would they serve this today?" Avalynn groans through a mouthful of her bread, "Did they know we'd be particularly bitter today?"

Brinelings were native of Navarre—a vegetable with a tangy heat and snappy crunch. Purple in color, with spindly hairs that had to be scrubbed away during its preparation. Sloane didn't very much care for spicy things, so she shovels her stuffed bread onto Aaric's plate,

"Thanks." he grumbles.

He looks tired, which is odd to her because he seemed so alive standing over Dain's cot yesterday. His green eyes just nearly appear absent of their usual sardonic spark. His hair messy, still done and presentable, but not the opulent disarray that usually makes him look untouchable—just undone.

"Devera has myself and Lynx, and some of tail section first years moving dress uniforms into commons; by the hundreds, mind you."

"Looks like we're graduating folks." Aaric exhales, rolling his eyes and blinking through the crunch of brineling,

"I'm with the healers," she stops chewing, "And I miss Kai, damnit."

Baylor rolls his eyes, "Who wouldn't. Dudes adorable."

"I'm with infantry, joint patrols at the edge of the Vale, reconnaissance and comms as the rest of the riot comes in."

Sloane looks up at him, "Think they're looking out for Dain's Reds?"

"Oh," Aaric sneers, "absolutely—finish your food Riot."

She rolls her eyes.

"So is he doubled up like Sorrengail?" Avalynn inquires; her brown eyes bounce a few tables down where their seniors have sat and now practically inhale their food,

Sloane makes sure their table is quiet before answering; she doesn't want to have to answer this again, "No. Dòrainn, that morningstartail, was his mom's dragon though."

"*Was?*" Baylor mutters,

Lynx seems saddened, "So his mom passed? Poor guy."

*Understatement,* Sloane thinks.

The day her mother passed, alongside her father, part of her died and in it's absence something insidious was born. Sloane wonders when Dain's mother passed; she wonders if the two of them were particularly close. With a pinched brow she ponders who could love a man like General Alloces Aetos.

"So the—so *Dòrainn*, has just been following him and Cath around?"

Sloane recalls their time in the Red's den back in Aretia, "Yeah, but I don't think Cath likes it."

*"He's just dramatic."* Thoirt sighs,

"Molvic says Cath doesn't like much of anything; says he's like Sgaeyl." Aaric adds.

*"He would most certainly not enjoy hearing that."*

Lynx laughs, "Cath seems plenty nicer than Sgaeyl. I mean, *okay*, so if we don't count the few dozen people who he stepped on?"

Sloane tips her head a bit; how morbid that they're already laughing about the situation, *"Does Cath not like Sgaeyl?"*

Thoirt's amusement plays in her own emotions, *"He sees the unfettered and wild version of himself in her. Cath values control—Sgaeyl prefers the... element of surprise."* 

"He says you should learn how to control your signet and your mouth." Aaric points his fork at Lynx, "What'd you do?"

Lynx's face shutter through dozens of emotions at once, Sloane can't help but narrow her eyes at him while Baylor and Avalynn exchange confused stares.

"What? Nothing."

Aaric shrugs, "Lie to me then."

"Lie? Why would you be lying about anything right now?" Sloane reaches into her pocket and slams a sound shield rune onto the table, it envelops them almost immediately after the smack of setting it down claps through the dining hall,

"If you're going to be my friend, or at least a close one, I won't stand for you lying to me Lynx." she snaps,

His black hair bounces at his forehead, "I'm not fucking lying about anything Sloane—and what kind of friend doesn't allow the people around them to have privacy?"

Her eyes narrow, "I'm not attacking you, but if you need the privacy that badly to get defensive about it, take it—and fucking *leave* with it."

"Sloane, bit aggressive?" Avalynn pipes, squeezing her thigh under the table,

"If it was nothing you wouldn't have felt the need to lie, Lynx. That's all I'm saying."

She spits out the statement like bile freshly swabbed against her gums.

His eyes flare, then search Aaric's face, and Sloane's right after, "I don’t know—I’m not sure what’s happening, and Aonach is still helping me okay. Just give me some time."

Sloane says nothing. Just stands there, feeling the first flicker of something she hates—a distance beginning to form, soft and almost imperceptible, but tangible nonetheless. The kind that turns into silence, and then absence, and then people who used to tell you everything start looking through you like they never meant to. She clenches her jaw and swallows it, hard, but it lodges anyway.

She doesn't want to be on the outside of the people she lets close.

"Look I'm trying really hard to be someone you can all rely on, but I *need* to feel like you need me too—I can't feel like a second option all the fucking time, and I get it, it's invasive and pushy but this is how I'm growing out of it. With trust. And I don't see why we shouldn't be trusting each other."

She takes a page from Dain's book—she risks exposing herself to those she feels strongly towards. To Lynx; to her squad since the message wasn't necessarily just for him. They could all hear her after all.

Lynx puts his flatware down, then sighs,

"Damnit Sloane." he groans while rubbing his fingers against his eyes.

"No shadows." she mutters, smiling to lighten the mood. She knows she went at him a bit roughly, but she regrets nothing.

He laughs, "There are no *shadows*."

"What?"

"My signet." He mutters, "It's not shadows. I can copy any signet that I've seen wielded near me for a period of time."

Her jaw *drops.*

"Now you—*no shadows.*"  Lynx blurts it out with a grin and as a rush of chatter meant to patch over the crack in his composure.

"I have feelings for Dain Aetos, and I kind of slept with him."

Well. That’s it. Her only secret. Her only shadow. She feels swallowed by embarrassment, and burned by the blush she knows is painted across her face.

It takes a few moments for them all—except Aaric, who already knows—to process the confession. Sloane watches it ripple through them in real time: the blank stares, the micro-pauses, the slight flinch in Lynx’s brow. She recognizes every beat of it because she lived through the same sequence not long ago—the quiet implosion of hearing something so absurd it breaks the natural order of your day.

Confusion comes first.

Then disbelief, then denial.  

And finally—comedy. Because none of them know what else to do with the weight of it.

Lynx slams his hands onto the table, "I'm sorry, *what?*"

"Oh, so you figured out how you feel about him?" Avalynn shrieks, "And how he feels?!"

The boys lance Avalynn with eyes full of disbelief and betrayal.

Sloane rolls her eyes at the pun.

"How do you *kind of* sleep with someone?" Baylor barks incredulously, "Did he pull out after one stroke because of the code of conduct?"

"So *you* knew and didn't say anything?!" Lynx shrieks at Avalynn,

"No—I," Sloane pauses.

*Gods,* was she really about to attempt to explain this?

Thoirt is laughing, the rumbling wracking against her head *has* to be dragon laughter,

“You _what?_” Avalynn all but shouts, practically vibrating. “Out with it, you bitch.”

Sloane lifts her head up until she holds the curious gaze of Avalynn’s brown irises.

"I can't believe you would keep this from us Lynn." Lynx sighs and, saddened, shakes his head. His black hair hardly moves.

“It was too big, and I told him I couldn’t, so he stopped and wouldn’t let me try again. In his defense, I was rushing it.”

Sloane breathes; her explanation is rushed, hushed, and when she catches Aaric's green eyes twinkling with newborn mischief she nearly groans out loud.

Baylor immediately drops his fork.

Aaric coughs like he’s been stabbed in the throat.

“Wait, what part of him was too big?” Lynx points at his temple. “You mean mentally?”

Avalynn gasps, clutching her heart, "When did this even happen?"

Baylor’s hands fly up like he's doing interpretive math. “Or are we talking dragon-sized big?” He spreads his hands, glances around the table, then narrows the gap. “Like this? Or this?”

“Can we not—” Sloane hisses, face burning, “he’s literally on his deathbed.”

Aaric chokes out a laugh, “Yeah, and you probably wanna be right there in it with him.”

Baylor sneers and swallows his water, mostly, "Please Sloane, he's surviving this. I'm *willing* it."

Sloane cocks her head at her dear Prince, "Should we talk about how you kissed his forehead? Even I've only gotten a few of those from you too, during *aftercare*."
 
Lynx leans forward, fully over Aaric’s plate, “You’re both sleeping with Dain Aetos? And *eachother?*”
 
Aaric glances down at Sloane, cool as ever. “Not recently. But for clarification—I like pretty things.”

He *winks.*

___

Nolon sings while he works—soft Navarrian lullabies in _traditional_ Navarrian, which means she can’t understand a word of it. Not that she needs to. His voice, aged and splitting with effort, quakes through the vowels and bends around the notes with a kind of exhaustion that feels practiced. Surprisingly enough, it’s good—good in a way that pricks her skin like cold air in early morning. But she’s not telling him that.

She’s not telling him _anything._

When he asks about Dain, she doesn’t answer. Just blinks at him—slow and sharp—and levels a look she’s sure could erode mountaintops or sour milk.

"He has always been such a bright young man, you know," he says.

His eyes are ghastly and too-bright, twinkling like the surface of still water right before something surfaces beneath. They watch together as Basgiath unburies itself ahead him.

 The floor beneath her boots hums with pressure, like the college itself is breathing in reverse. He works in clean, methodical pulses—first the general’s quarters, then the administrative building, then outwards from there like the blast radius of something much gentler than Cath's impact.

Bodies are unearthed. Some carried out by healers, others rolled like discarded parchment into canvas bags for burning. The air smells like ash and iron and blood. And still Nolon sings.

Glass _slides_ across itself in perfect synchrony, catching sunlight and splitting it into rainbows before refolding. Cobblestones leap back into form with not even a whisper of effort. Entire archways snap into place. Mosaic windows realign like they were never shattered—as if the building is remembering itself under his direction.

Nolon doesn't look at any of it.

No hand gestures. No dramatic glow of power. Just that song and his steady feet pacing ruined halls, as if he’s sweeping a kitchen floor instead of reassembling centuries of history.

It should make her uneasy, but instead, it makes her quiet. Very quiet.

Had it been Brennan, she might’ve let her eyes widen a little, maybe bounced once or twice on the newly set stone just to test its give. But here? Now? She keeps her arms crossed and her expression flat—stiff as mortar. Because the truth is this: watching a single man—_this_ old man—pull Basgiath out of its own grave with nothing but grief and melody?

It’s one of the most epic things she’s ever seen.

And she’s absolutely not saying that out loud either.

"So," one of the riders Maiselle *supplied,* begins, "your signet, can you take my magic and do things with it besides transfer it?"

Sloane thinks of Ridoc’s dagger and the iceberg it birthed in the valley.

"Not very well yet," she admits. "But yes."

"Cool." he mumbles as they finish with the second floor of the administrative building,

"Nolon could just keep mending as long as you replenished his magic?" the girl says, she's taller than all of them with bright blue hair and eyes just as vivid,

"I could," Nolon hums, hands entwined behind his back, "Cadet Mairi has a truly impressive signet."

"Yeah, it just hurts a bit, well a lot kind of, but I agree,"

Nolon laughs, "It is an equivalent exchange for the rarity of the gift she bears."

Thoirt prickles with pride, but Sloane checks her: *"Thoirt—we don't like him."*

*"We don't?"* She asks while projecting the intent to kill in their bond,

*"We hate him."* Sloane declares, eyes rolling as Nolon smiles at her.

She watches as wood, stone, and sconces climb over themselves in a grotesque hill of repair; there's so much material here for recruitment—she sneers, and nearly tells them to add their optimistic conversation to the motivational prints plastered throughout Navarre.

Something tells her they'll need it.

---

Battle brief is held with only Fourth and First Wing in attendance, and they file in like specters. The lecture hall feels large today, like the walls have pulled back just slightly to make even more room for what’s obviously missing. Light from the upper windows spills down in cold streaks, dust drifting through it like ash wandered over from the destruction of the administrative building waiting to settle. 

No one speaks. The air carries that charged silence—tense, hollow, brimmed with static.

Professor Devera steps to the center of the dais. Her boots click once against the stone and then stop. She stands tall, spine straight, uniform spotless—every edge of her looks ironed into place.

“The Lieutenant Colonel and the Aretian Generals are delivering this message to your peers in Aretia,” she begins. Her voice is steady, crisp—not cold, exactly, but like she’s filed it down for sharpness.

"In light of the recent tragedy, there have been some changes enforced to the upcoming schedule."

She waits as the last of the stragglers make their way into the lecture hall, then begins to speak again. Sloane notes how bright she looks,

"Firstly, until further notice fliers will be resuming all classes with the leadership and active-duty riders in Aretia—until further notice. Rune intensives will still happen in their two-week rotations, as well as the current course load."

Devera pauses, "Graduation will commence a week from from today, and Solstice right after. Unless scheduled otherwise."

"Guess everyone is expected to be back tonight." Aaric whispers to her,

Sloane doesn’t answer. She’s still watching Devera, though not really listening anymore—her voice has taken on that distant quality, muffled like it's behind a wall she leans against,

Devera lifts her chin slightly, scanning the room.

“As for the events that unfolded on this campus—the loss of professors, staff, and cadets alike—these will be handled at a level above your rank. You are not to involve yourselves.”

There’s a beat of quiet after. Not stunned silence—just a pause as they wait for her to finish what she's saying,

“That means no rumors. No dramatics. No storytelling for attention. If you speak on it, speak to your superiors. Otherwise—don’t.”

She doesn’t know what happens now—not to them. Not to Dain, not to Cath. She doesn’t know if the Empyrean will see them as loyal or dangerous, whether they’ll be punished together or pardoned as a single unit.

Will Empyrean deign their judgment worthy of rider and bond—or abandon them to the hands of humans? Of Navarre and Basgiath.

Sloane reckons with the brutal truths of what possibly happened in that office will ever be spoken of—whether anyone will call it what it was, or if it’ll be softened into something more tolerable, something with just enough political polish to let his father walk free. There’s precedent for that, after all. Men like him don’t vanish—they pivot, reappear somewhere higher, somewhere quieter.

"So we're just not talking about it?" she mutters to Aaric,

He nods, "Think about it: all of this circles back to if the General had a legitimate reason or not, and even if somehow there is a reason the Empyrean are the ones who hold Cath accountable. We," he motions to the room of cadets, "can't do shit about it."

"I swear everyday is just another way to find out precisely how powerless we are,"

Aaric only shrugs.

---

General Augustine Melgren makes an appearance the next morning.

Though Sloane can't quite make out his features from where he stands at the dais, she's certain his face is combination of loosely displayed aggravation and disinterest in his cadets. He's joined by Professor Kaori, and some leadership from the other quadrants.

"One gold this is about Dain." Lynx says through the side of his mouth, his voice is hushed and quick.

Baylor nods, stiff at attention, and even more so when Rhi cuts her eyes at him—guess she thought he was the one who spoke.

*"Is it?"* Sloane asks Thoirt,

*"Likely."* she responds instantaneously as Melgren begins to speak,

“I’m aware that the altercation between Wingleader Dain Aetos of Fourth Wing and his father, General Alloces Aetos, has caused distress among the ranks. Let me remind you—violence, destruction, and death are not new here. They are the cost of proximity to power."

Sloane has to close her eyes and release enough of the air in her lungs that she feels her shoulders sag. Of course Melgren would reduce what happened to Dain to some inevitable byproduct of leadership, like torture was just another box checked off the syllabus. Nothing senseless, nothing criminal—as if it weren’t a deliberate, sanctioned act of brutality against someone. Pain, after all, is just part of the package here. What a fool she is, to keep expecting these men to call things what they are.

He pauses to think, tipping his head up to where Codagh dominates the airspace above.

“In the coming weeks, you will prepare for many things to change. With those changes, you will adapt, overcome, and assert the dominance your dragons—and I—expect you to wield when it becomes necessary.”

Melgren steps away from the center of the dais, raises his hand and effectively places the whole quadrant at ease,

“Let me remind you—*favor* must be earned to be held. Power begets power, and with it, respect. But I would be remiss not to advise you: recognize your strengths. Be they physical, magical, or mental—find where yours lie, and excel. Lest you find yourself dead, bested by someone who simply wanted it more.”

He passes by her squad, and though his tone remains indifferent, his face wears aggression the way Xaden’s shoulders bore the weight of lives and war—always tense, always prepared.

Melgren halts between Third and Fourth Wing, hands laced behind his back, while completing a slow, deliberate rotation as he surveys the two groups.

“I will be stepping in, in place of General Aetos, while his shortcomings are assessed.”

His beady brown eyes sweep over them like a scalpel—his use of *shortcomings* nearly makes Sloane jump.

Melgren knows this was *wrong*.

“I expect proper military bearing and a shift in the mindset of our riders as King Tecarus and His Highness, King Tauri, move to reestablish flier participation and accommodations. As for Fourth Wing—” he pauses just long enough for the air to still, “—it seems you’re a group held in high regard among your professors. As such, I will extend to you _favor._"

The whole wing tenses as he turns to face Maiselle and their section leaders,

"You may visit your Wingleader as he recovers and resumes Squadron oversight in Aretia during your Summer Solstice. An additional day has been granted to accommodate travel arrangements for those who request it.”

Sloane’s heart flutters—nearly beating through her chest hard enough to crack a rib. Her knees lock, and she forces them to bend again, fidgeting like so many others in the formation.

Just a week, she thinks. A week until she can see him again.

*“Cath will be delighted to see you,”* Thoirt hums.

Sloane’s head jerks slightly. *“Why would Cath be happy to see me?”*

There's a pause—brief, but loaded with amusement—before Thoirt gently ties a knot, a Buntline Hitched knot, in their glittering bond.

*“You’re an extension of myself,”* she replies smoothly.

*“Did you just lie to me? That sounded like a lie.”*

Thoirt snorts, overly dramatic. *“I have no need.”*

Melgren’s voice drifts back toward them as he steps away from the gathered ranks.

“I'm impressed by the speed at which you recovered your leadership and completed your objective—given the circumstances. I trust the other Wings will soon catch up.”

With that, he returns to the dais, nodding once to Maiselle, who salutes him crisply.

Professor Kaori steps forward next, dismissing them with a short, clear command—and just like that, they’re released back into their day—but not without a hooting celebration from Fourth Wing, particularly Iron Squad,

"Oh bless it." Maiselle groans as she folds into the wing, "I hope Aretia is ready with room and board after next week,"

"I feel like this was arranged overnight," Rhi remarks while scratching at her chin, "Do you think Violet had a hand in that negotiation?"

Ridoc, rather seriously answer as Baylor, Avalynn, and Aaric step towards their seniors with herself, "That had to be either her, or Cath."

"Do you think he'll be healed up by then?" Maiselle asks, wincing likely at the memory of Dain damaged and bound in his cot,

Sloane speaks up this time, confidently, "He was poisoned, so there's no telling; but Brennan seemed to have a hand on it after getting him stabilized."

Aaric nods, "She had to burn what, three riders, for Brennan just to get him to that point too."

Sloane finds herself smiling at his wording—diplomatic Aaric being politically correct for her as always. *Burned* as in burned out, rather than drained, like venin, makes her grin,

“Thanks,” she murmurs. “For saying burned.”

He only smiles softly, “You’re not venin.”

Before she can respond, a sudden flash of light cracks through the courtyard—

“—the fuck?” Baylor groans, knuckles pressed to his eyes. “What was that for?”

Avalynn's mouth drops open like a caught fish, "Is that the light you see before Malek?"

Maiselle grins, already casting again. “Aetos showed me. Fliers call it a _flare_. Helps them track each other in the sky when it's crowded.”

She does it again then casts lesser magic once more to summon the rest of the wing.

"We've got a week till we're all a step closer to where we're meant to be in this life. With General Melgren being here I expect the absolute best out of all of you; in regulation, where you need to be, doing what you need to be doing. At. All. Fucking. Time. Understood?"

The *yes ma'am* that rings through the courtyard echoes over college.

"Let's assume that what happened two days ago is a pivotal point in Basgiath's history. No matter what it might mean, and who it might place you with, remember that we are fighting this war *together* and for the sake of mankind and magical beasts alike." 

Heads nod in all direction, bolstered and focused, and Sloane admires the flame Maiselle has rekindled in the eyes around them.

"Aetos once told me," Maiselle adds, lowering her voice just enough for the words to land: "there is no time to like and dislike when we face a common enemy—only life in unity or death in pride, so choose *wisely.*"

She lifts her tone over them, commanding now, “No class this week,” she finishes. “Just prep and grunt work, sparring and weapons training. Report to your section leaders. And if you find yourself in the spotlight of discipline…”

She flashes a warning smile.

“Prepare for *strict* correction. Aetos style.”

The wing dissipates, and as Sloane and her year-mates head to signet sparring they catch Generel Melgren nodding in quiet approval, then stilling as he watches them enter the rotunda past him.
