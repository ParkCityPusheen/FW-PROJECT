He remains in the courtyard with all three Reds until Fourth Wing floods back through the tunnel and spills into the field—led, _of course_, by Iron Squad. He hears his name being shouted left and right; apparently they can't see him behind Dòrainn.

Thoirt and Sliseag have moved off to the left, checking each other for wounds while Dòrainn, ever watchful, steps over and behind Dain again—backing away just enough that the incoming cadets don't hesitate to approach.

Cat and Sloane lead the pack, Violet, Ridoc, and Sawyer are just behind them, followed by the rest.

"Did he really have his dragon attack you in the open?" Cat snaps.

"We should just kill him at this point," Sloane adds flatly, grabbing Violet’s hand. "Can’t we?"

Violet lifts her gaze to him from Sloane’s. "What just happened?"

“Mealladh—” he starts, voice tight. Then, projecting with lesser magic: “I appreciate the concern, but I need all of you to get to class before this gets questionably worse.”

The Wing grumbles, reluctantly, but begins filing out as Maiselle chaperones them away. Dain follows, leading Iron Squad to the rotunda steps.

“I don’t think she was told to do that,” he says, chewing his bottom lip. “But I don’t think he tried to stop her either. Not that she would’ve listened—she usually doesn’t.”

That much was true.

Twice Cath had been within range of his father's Brown and _both_ times the Red had physically corrected her—by tooth or by talon.

"Have you seen Cath?" he asks, just as Violet opens her mouth.

"You don’t know where your dragon is?" she gapes, blinking rapidly.

Dain points to his head, then to Dòrainn. "He’s got me shielded. Right now, I’m assuming Cath left his den to babysit me?"

Sloane’s gaze darts between Cat and Violet, "Thoirt says you’re not far off—" she pauses, eyes snapping to her Red farther down the courtyard, "—he’s with the Empyrean."

Sawyer bobs his head awkwardly behind them.

"Sliseag says he’s snitching the _second_ Cath’s back. Told me the General should start praying to his gods now."

Dain narrows his eyes at the dais, still slick with Mealladh’s blood.

"I have no idea what the fuck is happening," he mutters, fixing Violet with a look. "But... I think I should probably talk to you."

Violet crosses her arms. "I’m not trying to be inflammatory—but is that something you _want_?"

Her eyes shift, blue to brown. He notices.

He’d like to talk to her—especially considering how close Tairn was in rank to Codagh. Surely, he’d know something. But beyond the politics, beyond war... he always misses her.

He’d adjusted to her absence. But he’d allow her back in.

He’d let them be proper friend again.

"I wouldn’t mind not being the villain for once."

"No one here thinks you’re a villain," Cat offers, nudging him, "Not the fliers at least."

Kai shouts in agreement from behind Sawyer and Lynx smacks his shoulder.

"But no one here _trusts_ me either. And I don’t want to talk about things that are... shifting the entire trajectory of my life, with people who don’t inherently trust me. Cath can’t even—"

He stops, and the words rot in his mouth.

"It’s confusing. And dangerous enough already."

"I get it," Violet says.

"Do you?"

"I do," she assures him whilst scoffing. "You’re me—after Liam. Before Varrish."

He flinches. Glances at Sloane.

_What a way to frame it._

"That wasn’t your fault," Sloane adds, her voice gentle.

"No, it _was_." He looks directly at her, craning his neck down. "It was."

"And you weren’t in control of it—but we talked about this. Stop being miserable; you said that's not what you wanted."

She leads him back to the cliffside near the Red’s den in Aretia—the place where he told her he was choosing happiness. It’s a silent reminder of their deepening closeness: public in appearance, but private in meaning. Her eyes don’t waver, they don’t flicker away when the rest of the squad peeks over at her; they’re still, glistening lakes buzzing at the shores—inviting him in. Beckoning.

"It’d be nice to tell you everything," he says, almost shyly. "But—"

"You _can_ trust us, Dain," Rhi sighs. "Seriously. Let’s get our shit together."

Ridoc nods, bouncing. "Yeah, like, what’s next? Triple signets? Quad dragons?"

Dain turns a slow, horrifying glare on him. "You’re about to find out."

"I’m guessing we should head off to class?" Sloane asks with a dramatic sigh.

He tries to soothe her with tone alone.

"Yeah... specifically first years. Where’s Imogen? Vi, Rhi, Ridoc, Sawyer, Maren, Cat—" Sloane rolls her eyes and starts wrangling her year-mates, "—I’ll see you all later. _Much_ later."

"No secrets for us?" Baylor calls.

"Nope," Kai says, dragging him away.

As Sloane heads off toward the flight field, she glances back at Dain and in smooth, luxurious Tyrrish, promises:

_"You’ll see me tonight."_

Shock flashes across his face and his head tips forward, flinging his brows off his forehead and to her feet, before he schools it into neutrality. Violet catches it. He sees her tuck it away, and he _knows_ that look—that he’s definitely going to hear about it later.

Eventually, Dòrainn allows him out of his sight, but only after _thirty_ minutes of grueling negotiation, translated begrudgingly through Sliseag. Violet is dispatched to leadership thanks to their efforts—specifically to Professor Devera—by Dòrainn, tasked with relaying Mealladh’s unacceptable behavior, and that Dain is to be confined to his quarters until Cath returns. Devera, understandably unsettled, kicks the Red’s demands up the chain and straight to General Melgren, bypassing his father entirely.

_Codagh_ answers instead.

Almost _immediately._

And that’s when Dain, and Violet, learn a new truth.

Dòrainn—the massive, unflinching Red who’s been shadowing every move of this unfolding disaster—isn’t just a dragon previously bonded to Dain's mother.

He’s a fucking _elder_.

---

If the last twenty-four hours could be described as _smooth_, tonight is the total upheaval of that illusion.

He's thrown up twice, and hasn't stopped having nosebleeds and migraines, and Dòrainn has been hovering outside the dormitories making all sorts of sounds, presumably speaking to Dain—about what? And how could he fucking know?

Out of desperation he showers, at five thirty, after sleeping for about two hours, and starts practicing _runes._ It's the only thing he can think to do after grading the last of tail section's second-years' foraging compilation assessments, polishing his boots, and whittling a whetstone down to nothing against his swords.

Cat had insisted he work on levitation runes since allegedly levitation was an easier, less-simplified rune to work on, and one of the handiest. She's claimed in Poromiel levitation runes were utilized frequently in construction and relocation.

Dain wonders if levitation runes could be used in the war effort.

If he could float groups of gryphons over long distances for periods of times, could they sustain in battle while airborne longer? He could help fliers get to Basgiath, by levitating them over the mountains of Drailor instead of dying while navigating through it.

His hands shake so badly the first few times he gets the shape wrong, and those practice disks are no longer usable. During the second round he gets the right shape, but can't get the proper amount of his magic affixed into the rune itself, so the discs launch at lethal speeds, lodging into the armoire and far wall across the room with violent force, until finally he succeeds in shape and amount and the wooden disk _floats_.

"Oh shit." he pants with a smile, "I did it."

He almost calls for Cath, before remembering he’s alone and his smile fades.

_"I see you, Knight. You are doing well."_

His stomach lurches, Cath's voice curls in mind and then through his heart,

_"Are you okay?"_ he begins, frenzied,

_"I am—calm yourself."_ Cath snaps,

"_Dòrainn—_"

Cath tuts at him, "_I am aware the troubles you braved today. I have spoken with the others._"

_"I know Dòrainn is an elder."_

He waits in the wasteland for a spark of shock, a feel of annoyance brushing against the flag there, but nothing comes.

_"There are some elders; he is one."_

Dain narrows his eyes.

_"Did you get in trouble?"_ he presses next, out of concern though... _mostly._

Cath snarls at him, _"I am an adult, I do not 'get in trouble'."_

_"I'm pretty sure Mealladh got in trouble today."_

_"I'm pretty sure Mealladh lacks anything besides space where her brain should be."_ Cath bites.

Dain lets laughter overtake him as his runed practice disk floats ahead of him.

"I wish I could see you." he whispers, and Cath beckons him in the sands,

_"Then come to me. We will go to the courtyard."_

Dain doesn't have to be summoned twice.

He pulls his flight jacket on over his sleep set then his boots, and tears out of his room to the courtyard, twice he nearly barrels through some cadets—to include Professor Kaori— but he reaches the courtyard in record time. As he stands there at the center of it catching his breath, Cath and Dòrainn break through the grey clouds hanging over the courtyard in admirable grace and synchrony. Streaks stain the air in their wake and leave traces of their paths beyond them, and he covers his face as they land on either side of him.

Dain drops his arms when he no longer hears the snap of wings.

"Cath," he pants,

_"I told you to calm yourself."_ He scolds impatiently,

"I haven't seen you all day."

His dragon drops low and close to him,

_"Hatchling."_ is all he offers.

Dain smiles, he takes the few dozens of feet to reach Cath and lets his whole body drop across the side of his snout, and his arms trace the outer edge of his nostrils.

_"We must talk about your magic, but within the confines of what the Empyrean approves."_

He steps back, and glances at Dòrainn; who watches Dain, his only eye the same color of the moonlit clouds fluffed overhead of them.

_"You went to Empyrean to ask if you could tell me about this?"_

_"It is what you wish for—what troubles you. As I bear sole responsibility of you, it is within my right."_

Cath steps away as well, so he can see Dain entirely with the swivel of his head,

_"You will listen well."_

_"I am."_

Cath's eyes gravitate to Dòrainn before he speaks again; they seem to come to an agreement eventually and Cath finally speaks again after Dain's breathing has finally returned to a resting state.

_"The magic we share, is not necessarily mine as much as it is yours."_

Dain's eyes twitch.

Humans don't have magic, can't channel without a ground—a bond.

He breathes.

If he were born channeling that would mean he was either a _dragon_ or _venin_ in the foundational sense.

_"You are you. The anomaly; because there is nowhere for us to place you does not mean you are right, or wrong, by nature or in balance."_

"So, what? I'm a human Irid?"

"_If you must classify things to make yourself comfortable, then you may call yourself as such._" Cath rasps, heavy with sarcasm,

He lets time pass in leisure before he speaks again.

_"Irids are dragons, nonetheless; you are not... one thing or the other."_

_"What am I?"_

Cath growls.

That _clicking_ reverbs deep in his throat and passes through the courtyard like wind and Dain waits, and _waits._

_"You are mine, and what was once Dòrainn's. And that is all._"

"But that's not all." Dain sputters, "That doesn't even make sense; so what, it's mine? All that I've been channeling is mine? I'm the one pulling from the earth?"

Dain hears his teeth grinding together more than he feels them, _"Cath, having to circumnavigate everything you tell me is..."_

Cath tucks his wings tighter.

_"I am doing what I can."_

He slides his chin through the grass, ripping up the earth as he shoves himself close to Dain carefully,

"_The magic you channel I have learned to regulate and return to you; I store some within myself. It is the reason you get sick often... because I cannot compensate for all that your life demands in it's natural state. The excess you conjure burdens you in an unnecessarily human process._"

"_Okay. So I channel my own magic, and you channel through me. So I don't explode. We're..._"*

Dain makes a circle with his hand,

_"Principally inverted?"_

Cath's mouth hangs open a bit, _"Yes."_

Dain's not convinced, "And your magic?"

The red's eyes slide shut.

Dòrainn sits close to Cath.

_"It was spared to maintain the balance in our coexistence."_

He stumbles.

Just before he hits the ground, a massive, battle-scarred wing arcs from Dòrainn’s body and _wraps_ around him. Not fully, just enough—like a curled wall, a shelter.

The wing tip tucks Dain in gently, like a dome of warmth and pressure. He’s enveloped in silence, in darkness and safety. His hand flattens against the breaking, leathery inner curve of Dòrainn’s wing, and his fingers curl in like a child gripping the hem of a cloak where the tatters begin. Dain doesn’t mean to. But he doesn’t let go, either.

_"The circumstances with which happened to keep you living have been entirely worth it. You wound me in questioning your existence."_

_"By technicality that would be admitting you can't survive without me. There's no rider for you after me."_

Riders can't exist without their dragons. And Cath channels his magic through Dain, not from the source himself—because he can't? Because he gave it up for a freak of nature?

Cath provides another sound, one he definitely hasn't heard before, one that he can't begin to describe,

_"I would not want to exist without you. Dragons are as cruel as you think humans."_

Dòrainn's wing attempts to squeeze him closer, but like Cath's body encircling Dain on the mountain peak, he's simply too large to succeed such a fine maneuver anatomically.

_"I can't ask why I'm like this can I."_

Dòrainn releases him slowly, and in the space that follows, Cath’s liquid-gold stare swallows him whole.

_"The humans will also bear the responsibility of your hidden truths; for now I entrust to you what the Empyrean allows me to."_

Dain barely manages not to laugh in Cath's face, "And, when they refuse—the humans?"

Their eyes lock; there's only one human he needs to speak to about any of this and the wasteland heats so unbearably as his father's face materializes in his mind, Dain nearly shields.

_"Then I will kill what keeps them alive."_

---

He swears he smells Sloane before he see her.

There’s always a hint of grass and lemon when she’s close—sunlight trapped in a scent—cut with something softer, like flower petals left to dry, pressed between sheets of paper. It unnerves him how much he notices it, and how much he unintentionally searches for it.

She's leaned up against the wall to the left of the door and dressed in leathers with her glaive strapped to her back, it clanks against the wall when she pushes off of it to greet him.

"I hope I'm getting here after everyone else," she begins, she looks him up and down, then speaks again,

"Where were you?"

Dain steps just ahead of her, closer than he normally would, "With Cath."

"How is he?" Sloane asks with a face twisted in concern,

"He's fine."

He was fine right?

Dain feels for him, finds his presence but Cath doesn't speak to him, he simply listens to the world around Dain—attention perking at the sounds of riders returning near him from their last moments of spent, and precious free-time.

They needed to be better at speaking with each other, to find a way to communicate effectively even when all the details weren't available. Dain could do it with his squadron nearly effortlessly, but with Cath he _expected_ more, always more. Always reason and transparency. He wonders if maybe it was because he was so emotionally entwined with Cath that he simply couldn't let things go the way his dragon needed him to—especially knowing now that Cath's reasoning in withholding wasn't just _because he didn't want to,_ it was because he cared so much that _he was scared to._

His head drops a bit and when a heavy breath escapes him and pillows against her face she pops up on her toes just a bit—enough to pull him away from his dissociative state,

"How are you?"

Dain looks at her.

He fights the urge to say something that would perturb Cath—something like _inhuman_ or _defective,_ and since those are the only replies he can conjure, he avoids answering it all together.

"What time is it?"

She scratches her palms, "I think eleven?"

He takes her hand in his and presses his thumb into the middle of it, holding the soft flesh securely at his waist, "It's late."

“I wanted to see you—” Her voice catches just a little on the last word right as he interrupts her,

"I told you if you came to my room late again that there'd be consequences didn't I?"

He lets his words dig into her, watches as her demeanor changes entirely and she shifts her weight, presses up against the wall again and lifts her face to his,

"I'm willing to bare the consequences." she mutters and threads their fingers together.

She shifts her weight again, a subtle fidget—one he knows too well by now. She only does that when she’s deciding whether to step closer... or bolt like she did on the terrace in Aretia.

He _likes_ that he makes her unsure.

"Are you?" he mimics her tone, light mocking in his voice but mostly warning.

Dain drops his head low to hers, lets their foreheads nearly touch. His lips ghost over hers—and he breathes in the nervous huff she tries to seal away from him.

Her fingers whisper over his knuckles,

"_Aren't_ you?"

He licks his lower lip and finds her eyes fixed stubbornly onto his, a sure glint fueled by simple defiance—she doesn't seem like she's backing down. He doesn’t move at first. He watches her and that tension at the edge of her jaw, the rise and fall of her chest.

She tilts her chin just slightly, a shift so small it could be instinct—maybe invitation.

They hover there, in the hallway of the dormitory, completely engulfed in the presence of the other. Dain hears a door open, then shut, the squeaking of wet sandals and the creaking of wicker baskets that cadets often carry with them to the bathing chambers.

A gasp—maybe even two?

Sloane lifts back onto her toes, and it's not a kiss, not the kind he wants anyway—she pecks him girlishly on his lips and tucks her index finger into the waistband of his sleep pants to pull him closer to her. Dain presses his arms at the sides of her head, hiding her from curious eyes as well as he can,

"You graduate from Basgiath in three days Dain," she explains, "I'm not sure if I'll get this chance with you again."

A door creaks open somewhere down the hall again. A pair of giggles echo, quickly muffled, and he watches her eyes flick to a group of cadets rounding the corner—then right back to him. Her tone’s too light for what she’s asking and she knows it too; Dain can see it in the way her throat tightens after. Her eyes, though—blue as broken glass and just as brittle—don’t flinch from his.

“Like a goodbye?” he says, low, steady. “That what you want?”

She doesn’t answer.

He lets the silence stretch, dropping his left hand to twist the handle of his room door open,

“I’m not a farewell, Sloane. And you’re not a consolation prize.”

He takes the smallest step away from her, pulling in a breath like it might clear her from his lungs—like air that doesn’t smell like her could make him whole again.

“So you're gonna reject me.” she whispers, dejectedly teasing and removing her finger from his waistband, “Tell me this isn’t the right time?”

Her palm presses flat to his chest but Dain doesn’t move.

“Tell me to go then.”

“I won’t,” he says, “But I’m not letting you give me a piece of yourself out of fear and impulse.”

“I’m not afraid,” she claims.

“Yeah,” he says, brushing her long bangs away with his thumb, “you are and you should be. But, I don’t want this unless—”

There's a clamor of swords and the unceremonious stomping of boots at the entrance of the hall—

"Do my eyes deceive me or is that Basgiath's poster boy—"

"Why’s she got the glaive? Why does she _always_ have the glaive?"

"—and the glaive girl herself? No fucking way."

"Bro’s about to get cleaved _and_ cuddled."

Dain turns his head towards them, jaw tense while flinging his door open completely,

"He only gives lectures, not dick—this is historic—"

"That’s her, that’s definitely her—fuck, is she going _in?_"

He enters his room with Sloane in tow, her wrist pressed tight in his hand and when she trips over the threshold of the door he pulls her body against him, barely dodging the way her glaive bounces dangerously near his face.

"‘Cleaved and cuddled?’ Sounds like foreplay to me." Sloane teases against his chest, "Which would you like first?"

He glares at her and she giggles.

After slamming the door shut with his magic he refocuses, determined not to lose the weight of the conversation,

"I don’t want this unless I can have you the way _you_ deserve _me._"

He doesn't give her a chance to respond, just kisses her deeply, angling her chin up to him with the hand that caught her,

"You have to be sure, Sloane. I can't just have a piece of you now, or ever. It will kill me."

Her eyes flutter open as he pulls away from her; she tastes so fucking _good_ that it leaves him weak, and seeing that drunk look in her face as he steps back nearly has his knees buckling.

"And how sure are you?" she says breathlessly, cerulean eyes flicking from his lips to his eyes; the left first, then his right,

"Deep in my fucking _soul_, Sloane."

Her mouth drops open, just enough for him to see those perfectly straight teeth behind her pouted lips.

"And how I deserve you—how is that?"

Dain's shoulders sink low, and his head sags, he schools his emotions and crowds around her again to remove the glaive from her.

_“Let me,”_ he murmurs, stepping close. His fingers brush her chestplate as he unbuckles the glaive.

He sets it beside his own blades, then returns to her like he never left.

"Wholly," he begins, now pulling the metal plating away, "Wholly, and honestly, and _willingly._"

He never did this with Violet, Never made the reasons besides his intentions anything but logical, so he takes a page out of Riorson's book and exposes himself, _explains_ the blinding emotions he's carried for months.

“I don’t know what you’ve been through—what left you so unprepared to cross the Parapet—but I’ve seen you, Sloane. I don’t need to mention potential—you’ve already surpassed expectations and probabilities. You’re so academically inclined that studying’s become a pastime, and your grades speak for your intelligence. You lead naturally. You’re a protector. A lethal attacker. The glaive? In just three weeks? Most people take that long just to get formation down with a sword. And you and Thoirt—you operate like you’ve known each other in another life. Through all of that, you haven’t needed any tailored help.”

He breathes, like he’s seeing her for the first time all over again.

“Everything you do is with intent. Even your silence. The only thing that’s ever held you back is your signet—and even that, you’re shaping like it’s just another weapon in your hands.”

He reapproaches her after setting the plate on the table, and brushes the back of his hand against her jaw,

"In my eyes, perfection is a gross understatement."

She doesn't say anything. Just reaches out and takes his hand, threading her fingers through his slowly, deliberately.

Unsurprisingly there's still too much left unsaid.

He doesn't tell her about the private conversations he's overheard her having.

Dain thinks back to the time he'd passed through a hall where she was consoling a wailing Lynx who was toiling at the licking flames of his own fear and confusion, how he watched him sink against her until his shaking no longer persisted. The time she gave completely valid and reliable advice to Aaric in approaching his narcissistic older brother and his face days later when he admitted it went smoothly to her in formation.

How, as much as she hated Cat, she held the softest spot for Kai; he'd watched them in the flight field—laughed seeing her bow to a gryphon before being affectionately smothered in feathered wings.

He doesn’t bring up Avalynn’s wandering mind—how it once showed him Sloane’s tearful apology back in Aretia. Or the more recent one, the real one, that left them both in tears.

Her adorable inclination to seek out Violet amongst her seniors, the handholding between the two of them, and the way she was never too far behind Rhi whenever she was attending her leadership duties. How she was perpetually placed by Imogen, who shadowed her just as often.

Humming in the archives while dressed in rider black.

He closes his eyes.

There just wasn't enough time in three days to get the point across.

"Can I borrow this?"

Her leveled voice shocks him out of his obsessive reminisce.

She tugs at his sleep shirt, "This one."

"I was just outside, you don't want a fresh one?" He grumbles,

"This. One." she simply repeats, then grins when he strips away his flight jacket and hands her the shirt, she keeps her face close to his chest—probably trying to hide the flush that's bloomed across her face.

He steps away to remove his boots as she begins stripping out of her clothes, then sits at the edge of his bed to _watch_.

Sloane pulls away her flight jacket first, facing away from him, and drops it on the table across from the desk. Her uniform top gets folded along with the bottoms and her undershirt, all neatly placed on top of her flight jacket.

His eyes burn across the bare skin of her back, the slope of her shoulder blades, the subtle line of her spine, and the flare of her ass beneath her waist and hips. She pauses, then hooks her thumbs into the band of her panties and eases them down her legs—slowly, thoughtlessly, like it’s nothing and when she tosses the delicate scrap onto the pile of her clothes, he has to clamp his jaw and eyes shut to keep the sound in his throat from escaping.

Each of her movements are methodical, unaware, unperformed—and that only makes it worse. There’s nothing in her that’s trying to entice him, and yet he’s caught and helpless in the quiet seduction of her body as it is. Her skin glows faintly and there's a soft sheen of sweat still clinging to her from where her back was pressed against the hallway wall, and he traces the rise and fall of her breathing with the same focus he gives to field reports.

Her hands lift to her hair, unbraiding the length of it slowly, and the way her muscles shift beneath her skin as she moves makes his mouth go dry. Stray strands fall against her back, sticking to her shoulder and waist where the heat of her body draws them. He swears he can feel the phantom weight of it against his fingers, and it takes everything in him not to cross the room just to press his face into it.

Sloane pulls on his shirt, and it swallows her, draping soft and oversized down her thighs but he can still see the shape of her underneath it—the curve of her hips, the dip at her waist, the outline of her legs—and Gods, she looks so _right_ in it.

"So..." she begins, pointing at his legs, goading him, "We really can't?"

Dain glances at his erection, snaking down his thigh.

"We shouldn't." he groans, sighing heavily.

He could, he definitely could, knowing she's pantiles and standing ahead of him and consenting, _asking_ for it...

But now wasn't right.

Sloane shares his exasperation and snaps her fingers; the mage lights dim into an amber whisper around them. She climbs onto the bed on all fours, then reaches for his wrist, guiding him wordlessly as he lays down behind her. Once he’s settled, she presses her back to his chest, and he pulls the sheets up over them both.

He buries his face in the crook of her neck, inhaling her—floral warmth threaded with something citrus-sweet—and aligns his body fully to hers. His cock rests against the small of her back, aching, and he feels the breath catch in her throat when she shifts to press closer. That tiny, involuntary reaction _destroys_ him and he presses his lips to her skin, just once, to ground himself, but it does nothing to steady the rush of heat pooling low in his belly.

"When did Cath get back?" she questions, softly,

"Just now. He left to talk to the Empyrean about me."

She stiffens against him, turns her head to where his face is pressed into her neck and squeezes his forearms that are wrapped tight around her waist,

"What happened?" she gasps,

He chuckles impulsively, because honestly he's not sure what to say and where to begin.

"Remember I said you should be afraid earlier?"

Sloane rubs at the hair over his arms with her thumbs, "I do,"

He bites her neck, probably bad timing considering what he's about to say to her, but does it anyway—in case its the last time he's getting the chance to even do it. As his teeth sink into the skin of her neck she _moans_ and presses against his erection,

"Cath and I aren't normal, Sloane."

Her laugh is breathy and reassuring, "In what way? What—are you biologically his or something?"

She stutters, realizing how that sounded, "I mean—not that I think you're—uh, shit. Sorry. I'm not sure what to say..."

He thinks it, what he wants to tell her, and shoves it to Cath.

His Red drowsily mulls it over.

_"Learn to trust."_ he commands, _"And go to sleep."_

"We've been bonded since I was a kid, way before Threshing."

Sloane goes absolutely stiff next to him while gripping his wrists.

The pause between them stirs panic in him, but he squishes her against him even more and smothers the anxiety before it can evolve,

"I'm not sure how, or _what_ I am. But he's been trying to.. help me."

She twists about in his arms suddenly, wriggling to turn away from the wall.

"Sloane—" he rasps, "_Wait_, please,"

He sits up, lets her go—

—and she flops over, flinging her arms around his neck,

"You didn't have to tell me that, but thank you." she says softly against his collarbone while dragging him back to the pillows,

"For trusting me."

Something in him caves—quietly, completely—as her arms tighten around his neck, and then _snaps_.

"We found out today—Violet and I—that Dòrainn is an elder,” he sputters. And then, as easily as breathing, it all spills out of him,

"Cath was gone all day—trying to convince the Empyrean to let him explain the constitutional nature of my magic, why I’ve been getting sick. I thought it might be magic before, but now I _know_ it is. Dòrainn has been pushing just as hard for me, but I understand the position they're both in now. Especially Cath."

She squeezes him harder, pressing up against him even more.

“Sloane, I...” He shoves his face back into her neck. “I’ve been attacking him, accusing him of hiding things—without ever asking why. I didn’t see what my existence had already cost him.”

"I'm sure he understands, considering the climate of the situation Dain—"

"No, I'm disgusting. And selfish."

She snorts, "That might be how you feel but it's not _who_ you are."

Her words bring him back to the sand and dirt, bathe him in heated tranquility as he plays them back in his mind.

"I know it's not my place to be giving opinions—"

"No, please," he stammers, "You're the only one I've talked to about this, so _please_ talk about it with me. I can't do this by myself. I can't, and I don't want to."

"How is that even possible?" she gasps, "I mean this changes everything, _again._"

He rubs her hips, thumbs gliding along the edge of her bones, memorizing the skin there like it’s the only thing tethering him to now. When she shivers, he exhales into her neck, heat rushing down his spine.

"I have to talk to to my—" he pauses, "—my father about it. The Empyrean won't let Cath tell me the whole... story."

He licks a line up her throat, slow, savoring and when she yanks his hair and bites at his jaw, he growls, guttural, _feral_.

"I can't talk to you like this, you're distracting me." she says.

Dain squeezes her, pressing his thumbs together just beneath her navel his other fingers digging at the sides of her spine.

"You're wet, Sloane," he snarls into her skin, voice ragged, wrecked. "You’ve been _distracting_ me since the moment we walked in this fucking room."

He's not wrong—he’s _known_ it—smelled her arousal the second she laid down beside him, felt it in the way her legs didn’t quite close at the apex, how the air clung to her heat. He dips his hand lower, sliding his fingers through the slick between her thighs—slick that's been waiting for him. The moment he touches her, his hips jerk forward involuntarily, like instinct takes the reins.

"You can't do that after you told me no—" she gasps, hands shoving at his chest, then fingers tangling in his hair.

"I’m not putting it in you," he pants, barely coherent. His hand grips her ass, pulling her flush against him again,

"But that's what I _want_," her voice is breathy and saturated in confused lust.

"Just behave—turn around—_now,_" he growls, voice hoarse and shaking. "Give me your ass."

She does, she _listens_ for once—fuck. She presses back against him and Dain’s hands are everywhere—grabbing, kneading, spreading her wide as he yanks his pants down just enough to free himself.

He presses his cock against her soaked entrance—not to push in, _not yet,_ but just to feel her heat, to torture himself with the ache of it. The tip slides through her folds and he _spasms,_ his whole body clenching. He'd considered grabbing the oil from his nightstand but they wouldn't need it; Sloane was _soaked._

He lets out a strangled sound that isn't even a moan—more like a _plea,_ desperate and broken.

"Close you legs on me,"

"You can't be serious Dain—"

He cuts her off by thrusting _just_ enough to drag the full length of himself against her slick slit again, rocking his hips with the friction until his breath hitches into something near a sob. His hand—the one under her waist—finds her clit and circles it roughly.

"—you're not being fair," she cries out, leaning into him entirely.

He glances down at her; her nipples are completely hard against the soft material of his shirt, pressing against it with the rise and fall of each on of her shorted breaths, her eyes are half-lidded and wandering, jaw clenched, and she bucks back—meeting his languid thrust with one of her own.

He does it again, flings the covers off with a frantic jerk to watch the glide of his cock disappearing between her thighs and reappearing as he rocks against her,

"Touch me." he snarls, pressing his mouth to her neck, biting hard enough to leave her marked.

His face crashes down into her nape, lips dragging through her hair as it clings to the sweat on his mouth. He inhales her deeply and the scent burns through him: citrus, warmth, something impossibly sweet that always clings to her skin. His eyes roll painfully while her hands twist against him. He stills his own, lets her grind herself against his fingers, lets her take what she needs—just watches her use him.

"What do you think?" he breathes, rough and ragged. "You think my cock would reach here?"

He presses his palm just beneath her bellybutton., "I think I could feel myself _right here_ if I was inside you,"

She sputters before she speaks, "Please put it in me, I—"

"You what?" He's still thrusting against her, one hand at her clit and the other squeezing her legs together on his cock even tighter,

He rolls with her pressed against him, so she's shoved into the mattress face down and leans back on his haunches overhead of her. He allows himself a moment or two of clarity before grabbing his length and pressing himself between her legs again, his tip bounces against the entrance of her cunt again—he lets it, even pushes into her a bit, lets the heat of her sex invite him an inch's worth before pressing down hard and sliding against the rest of pussy and her clit again,

"Take what you want Sloane, _move,_" he snaps, lightheaded and panting while he thrusts against her,

She whimpers into the mattress, knees pushing apart just slightly. Her hips play back in slow, cautious circles—testing him, teasing herself. Probing how much of him she can take.

When her cunt drags against the underside of his cock again, he groans deep and sharp, almost aggravated.

"That’s it," he croaks. "Just like that."

She does it again, and he watches—_feels_—his tip catch and press, _catch and press_, until finally she tilts her hips just right and _sinks_ down onto him, inch by slow inch.

Dain’s mouth drops open. His hands tremble against the small of her back,

He doesn’t breathe.

"You—" his voice breaks. "_Sloane—_"

She doesn’t stop. She pushes back until he's buried _deep,_ until her ass is nearly flush against his thighs. There's no resistance, just the tight, wet, feel of her that suffocatingly grips him,

"Fuck, _fuck,_" he chokes, doubling over her, hands planted beside her head now, breath catching violently as he fights the urge to slam into her like he’s an untrained mutt.

"Almost—" he gasps, pressing his forehead to her spine.

Her cry is breathless, strained. _"I can't take anymore,"_

Her admittance cuts into his lust just enough that he realizes he could hurt her, and that he wasn't exactly _safe_ at the moment. He looks down, committing the sight of himself buried inches into her, with just a few left till completion,

"That's fine—we can't," he pushes her into the mattress to stop her from moving while he unsheathes himself, "I'm not on the suppressant, and I don't want to hurt you if you can't take me,"

He catches the underside of her throat and pulls her upright. They both rise to their knees, Dain's eyes dragging down her body until they land between her legs—watching himself, flushed and throbbing, still slick with her arousal.

"You're not on it? _Why?_" She sputters as he repositions them,

Dain starts rolling his hip against her again, "Cath doesn't like me taking synthetic stuff."

He groans when she reaches between them and grabs him, pumps him once—slow, deliberate—then grinds her sex along his length.

"I could, I just need—"

"Sloane," he warns; he slides his hand up from her throat to cradle her jaw and kisses her—slow and needy—while she arches her back again, hips shifting so that every slow roll of her body drags his cock across her clit,

"But I want to come," she blurts into his mouth,

"Use me," he commands, "Go ahead,"

He reaches between them, and she grabs his hand, guiding him lower, placing his fingers exactly where she needs them.

Dain watches, mouth open while her head drops to his shoulder as she moans his name against his neck, teeth breaking into his skin. She bucks against him, working to undo herself, playing with his tip while gently pulling it against herself. When her body begins to tremble, he captures her lips—

"Let me see, Sloane," he begs. "Show me, baby. _Please_."

His name is off her lips between the crests of her peaking orgasm, and she falls to the mattress with her ass hitched in the air, pressing the entrance of her pussy against his tip, fluttering around his crown as she fondles herself through it,

"Touch me too," he whispers, chest heaving, before rocking his hips once, twice—then sliding past her spasming sex and into her grip,

He falls apart the second her fingers wrap around him—hips jolting forward, forehead pressed to her back as he comes with a broken cry. Her name claws out of his throat, just a sound at first, a mantra he mouths against her shoulder as the last of it leaves him.

He kisses her all over while she descends her pleasure.

He knows he's heavy—nearly twice her size—but he lets himself recover while draped across her body, hyper-focused on the steady beat of her heart under his chest, stealing the heat from her body, and memorizing the feeling of her silken hair stuck between them and splayed against his pillows. His tremors end long before hers do, before the hitch of her breath breaks even, before Sloane can even coherently speak as she comes down from her high. When he moves to clean himself up and change his pants, Sloane watches with fogged eyes and a half smile, but it twists into displeasure when he reaches for the door,

"Where are you going?" she demands, voice broken and spent,

“Hot water—I need to clean you up,” he says over his shoulder. He’s already halfway out the room.

It’s _late_ now—maybe one in the morning—and as the hallway blazes alight with mage light after the door closes behind him, he drops to the floor, shirtless, sockless in his boots, and still half erect and softening further.

It probably would've made more sense to just fuck her properly—he’d had, what, ten minutes to give in? But after tonight’s revelation about his origin story, Dain isn't entirely sure that wouldn’t have qualified as some kind of interspecies violation. It might've turned into an interdimensional summoning ritual.

He squints at his hands, turning them over.

Still very human.

He thinks.

_Probably._

_"Fantastic. The mating rituals of the deranged. Shall I make coffee?"_ Cath scolds, the sarcasm so sleepy, sharp, and unexpected it makes Dain’s arm hair stand on end.

_"Oh Gods, Cath—"_ Dain groans, the sound echoing down the stone corridor as he drops his face into his palms and _thunks_ it against the thermos he brought with him,

_"Don’t involve them. These thoughts are entirely your own."_ Cath snaps,

_“Yeah, well, turns out identity crises are a kink now.”_ Dain advises him.

_“If you don’t rise at first light, I will personally escort you to a deeper crisis. Sleep. Now.”_

_“Got it. Bed. Death. Crystal clear. Just—just let me do this._"

Cath abandons him for sleep and Dain scurries down the hallway.

In the bathing chambers there's only a few cadets up still, some showering, probably awake involuntarily and turning over from watch. There are five or six at the sinks brushing their teeth and giving Dain sideways glances with wide-eyes as he waits for the water to heat.

He can feel the staring of someone close, it makes his skin prickle, and he snaps his head to the left and meets the brown eyes of a rider twice the size of him from flame section in Third Wing; Ezra.

"Good night?" he drawls against his toothbrush, his eyebrows bump suggestively as he tilts his head down, prompting Dain to look ahead and into the mirror.

Sloane has graffitied his body in scratches, hickeys, and bite marks—most clustered around his neck and collarbones, but scattered across his hips and shoulders too, all dark and unmistakably fresh. He wonders how far gone he must’ve been not to notice her marking him this thoroughly—no uniform top is going to hide any of it.

Dain stays quiet a moment under Ezra’s lingering stare.

"Yeah," he sighs, gaze distant, body sore, "Finally."
