### [Chapter 9](https://archiveofourown.org/works/63478354/chapters/165139783): Dain | Off-Kilter

“You’ve been busy.”

“You too.”

Violet hesitates, “Are we okay?”

Dain gives her a look that makes her avoid his own,

“Were we ever?” He strains; it's now the second time she's brought up their decayed friendship. This far along in their timeline of happenings, best friends or even friends at all felt like it had been left to Violet's convenience based discretions,

“I can help you just as much as I can, not being your friend as I could being it.”

Violet winces, “I guess I've put my foot in my mouth.”

He searches for a way to put his intentions in words, “Not really. You just made a choice. Chasing you blindly doesn’t leave me anything." he never drops his eyes from her person, and when she finally looks at him she seems understanding, "So I guess I'm making mine too since I have nothing left to give really."

Thanks to Violet he'd learned what it meant to disregard rules. Being thrown into discomfort meant adapting overnight, and making decisions in the heat of the moment even faster. He could admit he needed this, in light of what he was becoming this was much better than being a puppet in Navarre's play.

“You have Riorson. And Rhi. And Ridoc. And Sawyer. And Imogen And who do I have?” He breathes, “I’m not blaming you, I put myself here; but I don’t want to be anymore. I don’t want my life to be a culmination of pining for you, losing you, and then sacrificing what’s left of myself to you. I don't want my character questioned after I've proved myself time and time again.”

He watches her shoulders bob and she moves to rub them.

“I would die for you if it meant the greater good of humanity. I’m doing us both a favor focusing more on the politics and war efforts, which I’m surprised to be participating in, and this,” he gestures at the tombs, articles, journal entries, all the texts she’s brought to him about venin, “I can help you more directly this way, instead of running behind you all like a kicked puppy.”

"I shouldn't have dragged it out the way I did." is all she says.

"For love we are certain to lose at length." He quotes a excerpt from the scriptures of Loial's temples, “You can talk to me whenever you want. I work for you and we’re friends. I'm graduating anyway too so...”

“Right,” she nods curtly, “friends.”

Dain neatly consolidates the materials she’s brought him, “I’ll take a good look at all of these, and get back to you hopefully before then.”

“After graduation,” her voice tilts just slightly, “are you going to be around?”

“Flight Maneuvers instructor; I’ll be right here in Tyrrendor.”

“Not Basgiath?” She blurbs,

“No. For the drifts, they’ll fly with us first before they get absorbed in Basgiath. I think the assembly intends for it to be an adjustment period. Get them ready for…” he lets memories of Basgiath trample through him, “_that shit._ And as supplemental training for active riders.”

She looks confused. Dain grinds his teeth.

“Everything okay?” He finally asks,

“Just been sleeping a lot. Kind of… just going.” She rubs her eyes with the heels of her palms, “The end of this month is next week which means everything is back full throttle, on top of War Games. Brennan and Felix, and Llewelyn have been prepping me as much as they can for everything but I don’t think that this is going to go the way everything else has.”

“Which is?” Dain cocks a brow and rubs his beard.

“Conveniently smooth. Minus the obvious things that were not. But either way, it felt like things were always somehow leveling out.” She looks around the terrace, “With Xaden gone I feel like that balance is gone. And I can’t just _leave_ to look for him. Leaving isn’t even an option now.”

She’s a Duchess and Cadet, of course not, Dain thinks. She’s not going _anywhere_ but Basgiath and back to Aretia. And Xaden and Aaric combined were certainly a hell of a power play, with the way things were now they would both need to reestablish themselves before doing anything unsavory.

“Well,” Dain offers the only solace he has, “That’s what you have your friends for right?”

She finally gives him a look that seems lively, “Right.”

---

He joins Fourth Wing for dinner the next day; it’s the only time he’s seen any of them so far. He ends up in line between Sawyer and Rhi, but seated between Cat and Sloane.

“I asked Captain Daux if there was a chance that fliers join the squadron.” Cat says as they all eat, she brings it up as Dain cuts into a chicken breast—one of three piled onto his plate—and chews slowly while she speaks, “Apparently since fliers are meant to return to Poromiel after graduation, the answer is no.”

She’s irritated.

“There’s only graduated, veteran fliers on the squadron. Same with riders.” Dain states, he turns his head a bit to look at her and finds her giving him a threatening glare, “I was only considered because I’m on the cusp of graduation. Also Poromiel will need protecting; of course you’d go right back.”

The assembly took their time deciding who all would be actively participating in the new unit. At a glance, it was meant to rally the civilian's pouring into Tyrrendor and to keep the Poromish's heads up higher. Nothing spoke favored odds the way unity and wrap sheets did. Of the unit of fifteen there were only two questionable persons, himself and a flier his rank; the lowest ranking on the squadron.

“Then why are _our_ veteran fliers volunteering for a unit meant to protect rider’s borders?”

Dain pauses.

“I think it’s going to be a joint-effort program. There’s only one hypothetical squadron right now, but hopefully they’ll be more, and they’ll be stationed anywhere that needs protecting from venin.” he sputters,

He combs through the documentation he received from Kiandra and Brennan in his mind; there were no input given from King Tauri, just Tecarus. A border expedition was meant to happen up Tyrrendor and through Navarre’s northern mountain ranges shortly after their indoctrination if their observational flight went well, according to Abdullah. There had been explicit intent that the tandem units would be stationed in Tyrrish outposts and along the boundaries of substantial Poromish Cities that still stood near the Barrens. But nothing regarding Navarre. Maybe because the brunt of the military was with Basgiath.

His eyes twitch as he considers more intricate details. Like the Second Aretia Accord.

The Aretia riot had been excused and allowed to finish their time in Basgiath, but afterwards how would Tyrrendor maintain its borders with a stagnant military. There was no war college here, no Parapet, Gauntlet, or Threshing. Would Tyrrish conscripts be allowed to pledge allegiance to the Tyrrish Independent Arms? Even more pressing, would Navarre _assist_ Tyrrendor in times of need as the politics evolved between itself and Poromiel? They'd already threatened to send troops over the border restrictions being lifted.

“Aetos?”

“He’s doing that thing Violet does.”

_“Isn’t that weird?"_ Dain presses at Cath through the wasteland, heating the air there, _"W__hy does it feel like Navarre is giving out all these privileges with the intentions of snuffing out Tyrrendor.”_

_“They could be. Their intentions have not been righteous historically.”_ The redtail regards Navarre with disdain.

_“Would it be crazy for me to think I could ask my da—,”_

_"Dain Aetos you will stay away from that wretched thing.”_

Right.

Cath had always been just a consideration away from mauling his father. Especially the years leading up to Threshing.

“Maybe after the my squadron gets officially adopted into military measures, you can request to be stationed with whatever gets drafter up for Poromiel.” He encourages Cat as he starts on the second chicken breast.

“Oh.” She glowers, side eyeing him, “We’re still talking about it? Thought you were finished.”

“Talking to Cath,” He assures her without bothering to make it sound convincing.

She perks up in her seat, and glances at Maren who sits across from her, “How is Cath?”

Dain waits for him to speak, but Cath says nothing; he’s listening though, there in Dain’s mind.

“He’s good.”

“That’s it?” She presses,

Before he can even open his mouth Sloane’s at her throat, “Cath speaks to his _rider_ plenty. Do you think you have a right to a dragon’s company?”

“Ugh,” Cat pinches her temple and leans back to look across Dain’s back to glare at Sloane, “Did I say that?”

“You’re certainly making it seem like it.” Sloane growls, Dain peaks at her from his peripheral, she’s leaned back to scratch right back at Cat, “And I don’t think Cath would appreciate that. He’s _very_ highly favored by his peers, and you aren’t one of them.”

“Kira already told me that, first year.” Cat spits, flicking her hands,

“What would a gryphon know about a dragon?” Sloane sneers while spinning her fork around her fingers with ease; it makes Dain think about the glaive flicking across her body,

“Considering they’re working wing-to-wing, a lot.” Cat bites, eyes narrowing.

_"What makes you so highly favored?”_ Dain wonders to Cath,

_"I am as I should be.”_

“Ladies,” Lynx mutters, “you’re scaring him.”

“I think he’s talking to Cath again.” Sawyer chuckles,

“He really just ignores us for Cath ninety percent of the time.” Ridoc guffaws.

“You know, Aetos I was wondering. Since we’re both familiar with mind work, why not train with me?”

Dain rips himself from the wasteland, “Huh?” He whitens, “What?”

“Wingleader Aetos’s signet is classified.” Sloane shrieks, taking Cat’s suggestion as impertinence,

“Think about it,” Cat stresses, “I mean you’re training Sloane to use her signet but who are you training with?“

_”Tell her yes."_ Cath commands.

“I haven’t trained flier’s gifts.” Dain mutters,

“Here’s a perfect chance to start. Might even be helpful for the squadron.” She leans in when she says it, and Sloane leans forward to watch,

Dain weighs the suggestion. She might be right.

“That’s ridiculous. If he wanted to train his signet he could just do it with me.” Sloane barks, gripping the edge of the table,

“Then why isn’t he?” Cat hisses,

“Who said he’s not?!”

"If you don't shut up now I'll make sure the voices in your fucking head are louder than you'll _ever_ be." Cat snaps, grabbing his chair to jerk him back so she can look Sloane in the eyes.

Dain closes his own.

---

"Kira thinks you need help." Cat tells him softly as she brings a piping hot cup of tea to her mouth, "I guess she and Cath, and the other gryphons from the squadron are having concerns about your personal health."

 Cath uncharacteristically has his ramparts up and impenetrable; he'd woken Dain up for breakfast and vanished.

"I'd be lying if I said I wasn't struggling to sleep." he suggests mildly,

"Cut the bullshit Aetos. We both know why you haven't been sleeping. It's the talk of the town."

He masks his doubt with submission; naturally the late-night sparring would disease the mouths of the personnel crowding Riorson House. Kind of hard to hide getting the shit kicked out of him as a nightly routine when there's always a crowd gathered by the end of it.

"Been out past curfew?" he volleys, mouth full of bacon.

Cat flicks her crescent thumb nail against the pad of her pointer as she blows steam across the table and into his face, "Don't piss me off when I have good intentions."

"Which would be?"

"Your magic, and your signet." she takes a sip, "Kira says you operating the way you are is dangerous."

Cath is _still_ blocking him out.

"It'll go away." the magic sickness, whatever it is, will pass; it had before and would again, "Why's it any of Kira's concern anyway?"

Cat gives him a unfailingly pitiful glare that suggests he might the most daft man she's spoken to all her life, "Because you're working with her peers: any other gryphon. Your peak condition is needed, naturally because they're betting on _you_ and _Cath_ to lead them to victory."

"I'm working on it." he states dismissively,

"You're not. You've been in the same shape for weeks now."

Dain slams his fork down on the table and she flinches, "And how the fuck would you know?"

"Because my bond can feel the magic emanating off you, and apparently its _suffocating_." she fires back with just as much aggression,

"Cath—,"

"It's not Cath. It's _you_." her body is pliant against the wooden chair she leans into but her eyes are sharp like knives and glint with accusatory heat, ready to burn through his next alibi.

The silence that settles between them is longer and sharper than it needs to be and she releases an impatient exhale across the top of her cup of tea as the rest of Fourth Wing settles around them.

"I'm not attacking you, I need you to understand that." she speaks in perfectly annunciated Krovlish as Sawyer settles into the seat next to him,

"Morning." the freckled Lucerian yawns, "Practicing linguistics?"

"I just want to keep the fliers as safe as they can be since the odds already aren't in our favor. I need you to be better." she finishes and completely ignores Sawyer, not even sparing him so much as a peek.

"How are you going to help me solve an issue that I've struggled with for years?" he presses before greeting Sawyer,

"Maybe you've struggled because Navarre's approach to problems are almost always wrong." she sets her mug down, "Maybe you need to think more like a flier; you already work better with them and that should be evidence enough to consider."

Dain barks a defiant laugh; Sawyer's eyes bounce from Cat to Dain, "It's because they don't know me."

"That's not why and we both fucking know it." Cat remarks harshly in the common tongue.

"Yes." Sawyer croaks, "Speak that one so we can eavesdrop properly."

Dain rakes his eyes down the table to see Imogen, Rhiannon, and few of the first years making their way over in the distance. He makes eye contact with Sawyer and Rhiannon before turning back to Cat,

"What are you suggesting?"

"You need to balance your magic."

"Is that you or Kira speaking." he snaps,

"Kira; but I agree, _if_ my opinion means anything to you." she gestures absently, fiddling with her braid, "Naturally this means using your signet, and I have nothing to hide."

Dain braces his hands on the table and leans forward, "You're volunteering to be exploited?"

Cat mirrors his motion, baring her teeth, "To exploit someone you must harbor ill-intention, and _y__ou_ wouldn't crush a grape in a fruit-fight if you didn't need to. Your quadrant might have villainized you to the point that you've convinced yourself you're a blight on Amari's great creation but I don't speak down to those undeserving of it."

"I'm—,"

"Stop acting like we should be afraid of you when you're afraid of yourself." she rises up from the table and lapses back into Krovlish after glaring at the rest of the table, "Let's head to class; I can't deal with the open mouths and interference."

---

Professor Trissa holds her first session of rune classes in the valley; outside the temperature is pleasant but the clouds billowing dark shades of grey and even blacker in the distance creates ominous foreboding within himself. Cat spreads the wooden disks between them as they settle into the plush, grassy earth,

"Make a sound shield." she demands, handing him a disk,

Dain feels his face contort, "I... can't."

She sighs and drops her head beneath her shoulders.

"Baby steps then." She snaps her fingers beneath his face before pulling his chin up, "There's nothing wrong that you can't, but this is rudimentary in regard to your privilege in wielding magic; there is no frustration here, only failure as a stepping stone to success."

"Tracking."

It takes _three_ hours for Dain to manage a sound shield that fits the two of them in an appropriate space.

"Aetos, impressive progress." Professor Trissa praises him, rubbing his shoulder from where she stands behind him, "Hand me the rune."

Cat passes it to her and her shrewd focus passes from the flier back to him.

"Did you teach him to forge the shape this way?"

"No," Cat looks up at her, "He can only manipulate his magic in certain ways and it deforms the intended shape; there's too much of it."

"Hand me a blank one please," they do, and she runes a sound shield of her own that encapsulates Dain's: it's nearly translucent except around the edges where her magic swirls against the circular boundary of the intended perimeter, "You see how my shield and yours vary in shape and color?"

Dain looks behind Cat; his is perfectly square, and reddish.

"Yes..." his vision tumbles over the other cadets around them and realizes every rider and flier who manages a sound shield does so in a spherical shape.

Professor Trissa deactivates her rune and Dain follows suit, "There is nothing incorrect with how your magic modifies this rune's appearance, but the way you've set the rune could use serious refining. Do allow me to inquire, how do you see your magic when you reach for it?"

He lifts a new disk and breathes in deeply, concentrating on that disturbing coagulation of raw power within himself and he _pulls_ at it, encourages it to leave its vestiges within himself and grasping it between his fingers as it raptures at the disturbed edge; it tears and frays at the edges and looks like stressed semi-liquid twine as he sets it against the disk,

"It's like a blood clot." He admits wearily, turning his head slowly to meet her curious gaze, "It's... _alive_."

"As most magic is," she encourages, nodding her head and tucking her glossy black hair behind her ears, "And you see and feel it in yourself? Nowhere else?"

"No," he glances down at the grass, then up towards the sky, "Nowhere else."

He lifts the disk he set his magic into and she watches as is dissipates slowly into the air between them, bubbling and burning away like lit parchment at the same time. He captures the moment that Professor Trissa panics, and the one immediately proceeding that she smothers it, "Keep at it."

When she's out of earshot range he leans back in the grass and removes his uniform top, it's getting humid.

"This is difficult enough as is, but doesn't that mean the ones you made for Mairi's daggers are even more difficult than this?"

Cat smirks, "Of course, but runes like that take time and dedication, and can be fatal if done incorrectly. This is simply setting a rune; tempering your magic into an intention and committing it to existence in a compatible medium where it will remain dormant until called upon."

She lifts up a blank disk and hands him another, "It took me a day to figure this out, looks like you might be the same."

Dain beams, "That's great."

"Do you feel more comfortable handling your magic now?" she yawns as she lays across the grass, blinking when he presses his hand against the practice disk again and packs them into his square sound shield again, this time a milky white opacity,

"Yes, but why is it so hard to _wield_ the magic; it's ours isn't it?"

"Just because it's yours doesn't mean it'll be easy; Sorrengail is considered the strongest rider of your generation and she can hardly aim, or so she claims." she touches their fingertips together and then pulls away, "Magic requires balance but the balance is never defined clearly, it's something you have to learn to manage."  

He doesn't want to talk about Violet.

"I can use lesser magic just fine. My signet..."

Cat stretches, "Can you wield your signet just fine?"

"I used to." he sighs heavily and drops the practice disk to pick up another and try again.

"What changed?" she's looking at him from her spot, her features are as genuine as her voice,

"My signet." he presses his lips between his teeth and holds her earthy watch in his own, "I normally have to touch a person's face when I read memories but lately it could happen if we're holding the same object, or having a conversation. Then, like I told you, I get sick."

Cat pulls blades of grass out of the soil and braids them, "Did you consider that you might be wielding your signet incorrectly? Maybe how you've been utilizing it is wrong?"

Dain finishes another sound shield.

This time, it's a hazy grey, and they both can see through it. But it's still perfectly square, and smaller.

"That would mean this entire time I've been using magic incorrectly."

She shrugs and rolls onto her back, "You said you had this issue your first year too. You might just be adapting in the wrong ways, maybe your body is trying to tell you that. After all, don't riders die to their own powers when they can't control them correctly."

"Yes."

She closes her eyes and drops into a silence that makes him think she's sleeping.

Outside the barrier their peers chatter and steal glances at them; a class has rotated through now, twice, and the dark gray clouds that had been behind the mountain peaks down the valley are now hanging threateningly low above them. They're plump and promise rain. He considers the two shapes he's learned and grabs another practice disk.

"What's the shape for shield?"

Cat scrunches her nose and features mesh into something that Dain might consider cute, "Like a proximity shield?"

"Can I make a shield to stop the rain from getting us wet?" He asks, rephrasing his intentions,

She opens her eyes and grabs a disk and her pulls her hand away to reveal three vertically intertwined diamonds, "I think it'd be this?"

He looks up and back at her sleepy face, "Hope it works."

"Don't want to just go back in?" she takes his finished disk from her, "Activate it."

Around them student begin to rise and Professor Trissa nods at them, she gestures that they continue by aggressively pointing at Cat and then swinging her boney finger to Dain. Another cube surrounds them, tinged maroon and clear, "No. I like the rain. And I don't know where Cath is."

"Are you hoping you'll see him then?" she looks around where his eyes do, then chews at her bottom lip, "We should get to wielding your signet."

"I promised him I wouldn't wield if he didn't know I was going to." he begins, almost a whisper,

"Why would you need to do that?" she rubs her temples, "Why are the two of you so..."

"I almost burned out a few days ago wielding."

She pales, "Oh yeah, he was going to burn down the house. I remembering hearing him roaring."

He gives her stubborn shake of his head.

"I'll tell Kira to look out for him. I think you should be brave enough to handle the magic he's gifted you without him; maybe it goes well and you an prove it to him."

"And if it doesn't?" Dain gapes, his hands fist the grass at his sides, "If I start burning out?"

Cat shrugs, "The whole point of this is to make you embrace your gift, I can't help you there."

---

He manages three long memories from Cat, before they fall asleep as rain beats against his poorly runed shield; it bends at just the faint pressure of it but keeps himself, Cat, and the earth beneath them completely dry. He's decided to only view what presents itself as he arrives in her consciousness instead of abrasively seeking out things of his own volition. Cat shares with him fleeting moments at Cliffsbaine, King Tecarus's palace, and of her first time seeing Basgiath. The method leaves him light headed between reminisces, but not sweaty and hot, or panicked. He reaches for enough of his and Cath's magic to keep him suffused in her mind and she lazily guides him through moments of her life.

It's all harmless and Dain traverses slowly, eventually breaking away from her guide as he cradles her head in his hand while she sleeps lightly across from him. The memory of himself and Cath catching her not to far from where they lay in the valley now surfaces:

"Catriona." he rumbles, clearing his throat, "Can I keep looking?"

He becomes fatigued from his casual perusal of her mind compounded with having fallen asleep, but nothing unordinary, "You don't have to ask." she huffs, scooting her cheek further into the palm of his hand, her eyes open to scan his face and close when she identifies nothing there but useless drowsiness,

"How are you feeling?" she whispers, "I can sense you moving around my consciousness,"

"Weird."

He frowns as he lets his mind slip away into hers.

_She'd nearly died, killed Kira in the process, and that's all she can think when she finally manages to rip open her eyes and sees Dain Aetos against the cloudless blue sky. He's smiling at her, but not one that sneers at her falter, or in anyway gloating that he's saved her life. It's gentle and forgiving—traits typically foreign to riders. The glare in his flight goggles absconds as he tilts his head down to hers, cradling her against his muscular chest,_    
    
_"That was scary." He chuckles, pulling her in closer, if it were even possible, and speaks some more. His calm, husky voice reverberates through her bones and she squeezes her thighs together—'just a reflex,' she tells herself. She only hears the gusts of wind that carry his words away. Only sees his impossibly sharp canines almost peaking past his full lips as he provides instruction to get her back on her gryphon. All she feels in his mind, just for a second, is the fear he bore for her as he and his dragon bulleted across the valley to her rescue. It perpetuates in his mind so uncontrollably she wonders how he's smiling and not screaming._

He blinks and glances at her face, she's still unbothered but her eyes are open, watching the rain glide off the sides of his cubed shield past his shoulders,

"Shut up." she snipes, fingers laced over her navel; Catriona is _blushing_.

"Wasn't gonna say anything." He finds himself laughing,

"There's another of you from recently." She admits breathlessly.

"Oh really?"

He can't help but admire her brazenness. Catriona's always been able to be herself unapologetically, paired with her sharp tongue and mind she was admirable. Dain had always told himself they would have certainly been friends when he'd first arrived at Basgiath, she would've fit into his group perfectly. They were a rowdy, smiling, and hard-working bunch that studied late through the night and sparred early in the morning. He could picture her there with them, smiling stupidly like he used to. 

"See for yourself." She grins, closing her eyes with him once theirs lock and he steadies himself as he slips away into the stream of her memories once again.  
    
_Dain's dragon descends upon him like rivulets of rushing blood from a fatal wound. His body is wound tight like a compressed spring and they speak privately, at first._  
    
_Cat watches curiously from where she and Maren spar at their mat, but as the Red closes the distance between himself and his rider, she finds herself becoming increasingly nervous._  
   
_"Would a dragon harm their rider?"_    
    
_"Considering they let them fall to their deaths quite often. I suppose dealing a fatal blow isn't beneath them." Kira responds; Cat feels her farther up the valley, but not too close to the dragon's hatching grounds parameters._    
    
_Dain looks like he's going fight his bond with his bare fists, or cry, the raw emotion twisting and damaging his otherwise indifferent facial expressions make her blink rapidly. He's a beautiful man, pleasant to speak with, and kind. But this version of himself only his bond could bait to the surface, is new to her. What could they possibly be arguing about that makes them both break their fortified facades?_  
    
_Cat approaches Dain from behind, watching his broad shoulders tremble as he screams at the beast, who seems to try placating him with body language; folding his wings, exposing his throat, extending his head until it presses gently into Dain. Cat's gravitation to the two magnifies at that; Cath's head is huge, but he gauges the impulsive movement with ease considering that singular part of his body is the size of a small house._  
    
_No one bothers to stop her as she approaches behind the pair, close enough to hear, but far enough to not disturb them, until Dain begins advancing backwards and he crashes into her, knocking her into the floor. Pain shoots through her hip and she ignores it, scrambling out of his way—she doesn't want to upset Cath._  
    
_"Promise me. No matter what it is and how I might feel. You'll tell me." He begs Cath, arms gesturing desperately._   
  
_Why does he look like he wants to cry?_  
    
Her hip?    
    
Dain pulls his palm from underneath Cat's relaxed face, reaching downwards instead to splay his fingers across the khaki fabrics enveloping her pelvis.

"Sorry," he breathes, "I didn't realize I actually knocked someone down."

"You were busy; I was being nosey." she snorts softly nodding to the valley ahead of her, "Looks like you're needed."

He follows her line of sight down a roll of hills where his executive officer, Maiselle, has landed her Green daggertail and sprints towards him, the runed shield isn't big enough for all three of them and she stands just outside of it, heaving breathes like her lungs were being squeezed of their contents while she's soaked through,

"This is where you've been Aetos?!" she bites, flicking him off, "Get the fuck up, I need you _now_! And you too Cordella!"

He checks for Cath as they enter the back entrance of Riorson House, his shields are still there, though weaker.

Maiselle leads them to an unused makeshift classroom, she grabs Dain's forearm and shoves him inside before asking Cat to stand at the door and slamming it shut in her face.

"Do you believe in the people's right to fight for their freedom against Venin tyranny?" she pants, tearing away her flight jacket and wiping off the damp skin of her forearms after rolling up her uniform sleeves.

"I'm the _farthest_ from a candidate for Navarrian loyalists Maiselle," he draws his shortsword and presses the flat edge of the blade to her throat, "and I don't appreciate those who don't agree to the protection of innocent civilians."

Her brows bounce in unimpressed shock, "Fourth Wing's marked ones are in danger."

He blinks. Once. Twice, and presses the blade harder against her throat, "What are you getting at?"

He feels movement at his waist and glances downwards to see the skin at her forearms ripple and fall away against itself like dragon scales, revealing freckled brown skin with a winding rebellion relic against her left one, "I normally trade secret for secret but I feel like you might actually kill me if I don't show my cards."

He sheathes his sword.

"Have I ever seen what you really look like?" he mutters drinking in her paled skin and hazel eyes.

Glamor magic, and the first he'd ever seen, he blinks at the compass adorned on her uniform like his.

"Haven't you?" she croaks, "You've been out of it since the battle at Draithus but right now about thirty-four marked ones in your Wing need you to pull your head out of your ass, replace it with that notorious stick, and possibly commit crimes in their defense."

He needs a moment only to breathe and thinks of Sloane.

"All right."

He was already a criminal to everyone anyway.
