### [Chapter 3](https://archiveofourown.org/works/63478354/chapters/163769770): Dain | Break

"So, the controls are: person, item. The variables are, amount and... _type_?"    
    
"Strength?" Sloane grits out, "Aetos's magic is downright diabolical, in comparison to say yours, or Aaric's."
    
Ridoc's head jerks back, "What do you mean diabolical?"  

She glances down at Dain and their eye contact is brief, "He has as much magic as most of our dragons do, and it feels... wrong." she mutters.    
    
Ridoc's face snaps to Dain's, "Is that normal? For you I guess?"    
    
"It's been like this since Cath and I bonded. I can still hardly control it." he admits shamelessly.    
    
He maintains his eye contact with Ridoc just a bit longer than he would've liked to and feels a sharp jab down his temple, wincing he adds: "Cath always says he is 'simply superior'".    
    
"Wouldn't superior have been bestowing you a fully inntinnsic signet then?"    
    
Dain's eyes widen, "No. That would be a capitol offense Ridoc."    
    
"No like, like Melgren, y'know," He gestures slowly, "Foresight."    
    
Dain shakes his head, its still throbbing.    
    
"This shit hurts so bad." Ridoc whines, he’s sweating as much as Sloane is, "You normally do this with Aetos?"    
    
"He doesn't feel any pain anymore when I do it now. But I can try and make it not hurt, I just have to expend more magic to do it."    
    
"Well could you?" Ridoc asks smugly,    
    
Sloane looks him dead in the eyes and serves up an angelic smile, "No."    
    
_"She is akin to an adolescent."_ Cath grumbles a warm laugh into the bond.    
    
Dain looks at the dagger she's holding; its the one she began imbuing with Dain's magic originally.    
    
"I think..." he begins, holding the small leather-bound journal he picked up from the archives to document his findings on Sloane's signet, "You need to use the same item for each person."    
    
"Yeah, daggers." Imogen says back, she's watching Ridoc wriggle against his seat.    
    
"No," He points to the leather shaft of the dagger that Sloane clutches close to her stomach, "Initially she used that one with my magic, she's trying to fill it with Ridoc's magic and its being... rejected by mine."    
    
Imogen raises a brow at him, "And how would you know?"    
    
"I can see it." He answers.    
    
"You... can see it?" Matthias parrots, "Like our magic with runes?"    
    
"No... Like every time Mairi activates her signet, I can see the flow of my magic where she's put it." He pauses, "So actually yes. Well, no. Only when she uses that dagger, and it doesn’t go away even after she’s finished imbuing."    
    
Sloane's listening and she removes her hand from Ridoc's arm, "So if I..." she grabs another dagger, it's wrapped at the hilt in a decaying wrap, and begins imbuing with Ridoc's magic again. She's sweating like she's been on the mat.    
    
"It hurts even more now Sloane, what the fuck!"    
    
She gives Dain an anticipatory glance and he locks into their stance. He can't see anything and shakes his head at her.    
    
"And now?" she sheathes that dagger and picks up the leather-hilted one again and sure enough the iridescent remnants of his magic glow subtly against the blade.    
    
"It's... there."    
    
"What the fuck." Sawyer grumbles. "So can you see your magic in the other dagger?" he asks Ridoc, and Sloane holds up the other one for him, he's rubbing his arm.    
    
"No, but my asshole is gonna start puckering if we keep starting and stopping."    
    
Sloane wretches away from him in disgust, "You're so repulsive," she hisses.    
    
"I think it's just me." Dain says to Imogen, "But I'm not sure if I put this down as a condition related to myself or her."  

He scribbles down the information.  
    
"Maybe just a anecdote off to the side; either way its a good observation. Its not like you can see your magic in other objects outside of ones you've set runes into anyway."    
    
Dain considers runes for a moment. With runing, magic is stored in different mediums for later or immediate utilization, in repeating or single-use, and can be layered almost infinitely if the person placing them is skilled enough. With Sloane’s siphoning, it seemed she could only pass into and imbue, or pass through to be used.  
    
"What if you tried setting runes in the dagger with the magic you siphon from me?" he asks Sloane,    
    
"I'll get sick again if I use your magic, and I get to go home soon." she grumbles.    
    
He winces. Another note that had been recorded in his siphon journal was that Sloane came down with an illness every time she siphoned from Dain for substantial periods of time. Her recovery and adaptation to the symptoms increased each time but it was something he'd like to avoid if he could; their rotation to Aretia was in three days.    
    
"You want to try it in Aretia then?"    
    
She nods, "Professor Trissa is there too, maybe she can sit in with us for it?"    
    
Dain nods back, "She'd probably like that."    
    
Imogen stretches between him and Matthias, "Violet is gonna flip when she hears you're training."    
    
Sloane grins.  
    
At night Dain reaches for his dragon through their bond. He plants himself at his desk and feels through his mind, sees their flag and the wasteland, but there are no ramparts to be seen. He hasn't felt a single emotion or shield from Cath, or even heard from him. It's been a full day and Dain begins to worry.    
    
There's a soft knock at his door and he already knows its Sloane.    
    
"Gonna let me in?" She asks impatiently when he doesn't move to pull her through the ward,    
    
"No."    
    
She peels back, "What do you mean no?"    
    
"War Games." He declares it as if its a heaven sent mandate, "The farther we are the better."   
    
"He won't just single you out, we collectively went against him Aetos. He'd take take us all at once."  she seems like she has a list of eventualities she's ready to fight him with,    
    
"I _know_ this man, Mairi. He raised me. Please stop arguing with me and go to sleep."    
    
He drops his head in farewell and closes the door.    
    
Its better this way.

Cat arrives at Signet Sparring the next evening with two runed daggers, one intended to receive and store, and the other to receive and amplify.    
    
"Try this." She says with a jerk of her chin, handing them to Imogen, who passes one to Matthias,    
    
"Sloane?"  Matthias urges, handing her a dagger.  
    
"Huh?"    
    
Dain pans over her. Her hair looks haphazardly brushed and he can see the telling traits of sleep deprivation growing in her features. His stomach twists.    
    
"Ridoc," she calls sing-songishly, pointing to the seat next to her,    
    
He fakes a horribly dramatic unwillingness and trudges over to her. Sloane starts with the receive and amplify dagger, holding Ridoc's forearm in one hand and the dagger in her other. He yips when her signet activates and glances down at the top of her head.    
    
"Are you feeling better?" Ridoc asks,    
    
"I think I've gotten over it completely now." her eyes are closed, they occasionally twitch, "Thanks."    
    
"You look pretty tired." Matthias says    
    
Dain marks the date on a blank page and scribbles away with his ink pen: _messy braid. runed dagger one: receive/store, runed dagger two: receive/amplify_.    
    
"This hurts so fucking bad." Ridoc grumbles.    
    
"I haven't been sleeping well the last few days." Sloane admits, keeping her eyes closed. Dain watches as she shifts her body away from his.    
    
"I think... it's done?" she tells them, blinking at Cat. "Is there a limit to how much you can store in this rune?" 

Cat narrows her eyes, "I didn’t weave any limitations."    
    
"I don't feel like I can put anymore magic into this. That's why I'm asking." she waves Ridoc's dagger, "I can feel magic running through me and where I'm sending it, but I didn't feel like it was going anywhere after a bit."    
    
_runes may have a limit to how much power is stored, no apparent stoppages in place_ Dain scribbles underneath the receive and amplify dagger.    
    
"Whatever magic you put in that dagger should double it's output when it's used. Do you know how _much_ you put in it?" Cat implores,    
    
"Nope." Sloane says, "I was not thinking about quantity and... I probably should have been."    
    
Ridoc takes the dagger from Sloane, "It’s kind of humming." he mumbles,    
    
"Like the daggers we use on venin?" Imogen asks, "I know those daggers have specific metal compounds. Don't know what it is though."    
    
"Did it feel different to you, Mairi?" Dain wonders aloud, glancing past Ridoc to Sloane.    
    
She ignores him.    
    
"Mairi." Matthias begins, her tone a certain warning.    
    
 Imogen passes the dagger to Dain and he holds it steady by the hilt to scribble that information down too _(Sloane's upset with me again?),_ when a sharp sensation skitters behind his eyes, and the dagger slips from his grip as he grabs his temples. It feels like a needle is forcing its way behind his eyes, threading through his optic nerves and he tastes blood in throat.    
    
"You okay?" they almost all ask in unison,    
    
He manages a groan and fishes for the dagger at his side, his nose starts to bleed as he hands it back to Imogen.    
    
Imogen _l__ied_, his mind screams, she's _lying_!    
    
He vividly watches the playback of Riorson explaining _exactly_ how they're made while stealing them from a Navarrian forge. Watches as he flips the blade over to show her the runes embedded in the handle and points out the components necessary to smelt the ore to existence around the station. Watches as Garrick shoves them into a sack, whistling behind them in the heat of the hearth. _Watches_ as they deliver them to a drift hours away, and watching said drift immediately engage with Wyvern as the escort bloodied, limping civilians away from the sieged town—  
    
He gasps and rolls to his side and pushes himself up, gagging. Gagging again, then taking his first meager step up the arena,    
    
"Hey!" Matthias appears at his side, "What's going on?"    
    
He glances at her and smiles, "Magic."    
    
Her brown eyes widen in concern, "Magic?"    
    
"Gonna go, keep training." he grits out, placing his hand over his mouth and retreating before anyone else can ask him anything else. He's weak and barely walking when he stumbles through the rotunda.  
    
_"Please, Cath."_    
    
_"Where are you?"_ the swordtail immediately responds,    
    
_"Rotunda."_ Dain drags his feet towards the formation field. His body convulses and he spews bright red blood, thick and mottled across the floor. Launching from where they hold formation is frowned upon, but not punished-unless of course, your dragon lands on someone.

There's a handful of riders at his side almost immediately as he makes his way into the clearing from the rotunda and their memories begin to flood into him as they offer him support, leaning him against themselves while his head lolls useless on his shoulders. He can hear, and taste, and see them so vividly that an unnatural migraine splits through his face. The light emitting from the sun practically blinds his and he stumbles, dropping to his knees as their voice raise in panic around him. Someone begins pulling him away and back towards the rotunda and he groans in protest; he _needs_ Cath, needs to be with his dragon _now_. He forces himself to watch the skies for his gleaming scales as he digs his heels into the grass.  
    
Cath is there minutes later, scattering screaming riders and fliers across the field as his shadow crashes down towards them. Dain takes off in a sprint for him, falling first as he dodges the Cadets gathered around him. Cath extends his wing in a show of mercy and haste, his scales shift along his vertebrae and the membranes pull tight at the spread so much that Dain's boots _tap, tap, tap_ as he sprints across Cath’s wing and onto his back, then into his seat. He's still spitting up blood when Cath coils back and plummets into the sky. He can hear the others behind him, and notes Sloane's blonde braid whipping fiercely against the force of Cath's trajectory. He bends over in the seat and closes his eyes as Cath finally evens out beneath the clouds, circling the college and effectively putting Dain to sleep.    
    
_"Be at ease... Be at ease..."_ Cath grumbles into the bond, as he soothes him with bouts of concern, reassurance, and thick, blanketing magic.    
    
When he comes to, they're still above the rotunda.    
    
_"You took a break and landed right?! What time is it?"_    
    
_"I did, you were sleeping soundly. It is before the sun. I am going to tell the lesser leader you are unfit to attend the morning formation."_ Dain doesn't argue with him, he doesn't want to anyway. He peers down and see the neatly packed rows of riders. 

Dain can feel his face wrinkle into a scowl. Cath really flew into the next morning? He'd been sleep for near eighteen hours then.  
    
_"Can you walk?"_ Cath prods, "_I will take you to the canyon, they will not bother you."_  He begins his ascent, his wings beating above them. He dismounts without Cath's help, and rests again the swordtail's forelegs before walking ahead him,    
    
"Thank you." Dain smiles at him, "I'm sorry for throwing up on you."    
    
_"Did you? I cannot tell."_ Cath blows, hot sulfuric breath at him, _"Begone, rest properly."_  

---

  
    
The sun is setting when he‘s roused from his sleep by a pounding on his door. It takes him a while to pull himself together enough to answer. He's sore and still nauseas, and his body screams in defiance as his muscles expand to lift him from his seat at the desk where he had fallen asleep in his uniform. He'd barely gotten the door open when his father's familiar silhouette makes him freeze, in that same moment he feels Cath alive and electric with energy in their bond. Gods, he never imagined he would pray on his life that it had been Sloane at his door instead.  
    
"Step out, Cadet." He bellows. Dain's room is warded. Of course.    
    
When he does, his father reels back and punches him square in face and he trips back into his bedroom. Pain explodes in his lip and nose, Dain can feel the blood dripping but makes no move to wipe it away, his father pulls his lapels back into place.  
    
"Step out, Cadet!" He screams in annoyance this time, wiping his hand off.    
    
He does. He crosses the threshold of the bedroom and his father lays claim to his face again, this time cracking his knuckles across Dain's left eye socket.     
    
"Show up for fucking formation, and class you filthy cockroach. You've embarrassed me enough. Do you understand?!" The man is so worked up he's heaving out his breaths, and a strong vein bursts along the skin of his forehead. When Dain doesn't answer quickly enough he hits him in the face again, twice.  
    
"Yes, General." Dain manages, standing up and pitching to attention.    
    
_"If he-"_    
    
He slaps Dain this time, and sneers when his head snaps against the doorframe. He winces and sees _red_, and fixes himself again, perfectly at attention.    
    
_"Dain Aetos."_ Cath snarls over the bond.    
    
In the distance there's an ominous vociferation, unmissably a dragon, but putrid and alien. Its one immediately discernable wherever its released, an eldritch baritone that roots itself into the memory of those who are folly to hear it—_forever_. It washes over the college like a virus, and everything around them vibrates. Dian’s nervous system overrides with anger seasoned with ancient rage and vile intent. His body shakes violently at the sight of his father.  
    
_"He will keep his hands off of you."_ Cath warbles in an unsettling synthesized wave of growls.  
    
Dain eyes shift downwards.    
    
"Stuck with that disgusting freak of a dragon," his father spits, "You skip another class or formation and I'll beat you six ways past Malek's Bay, boy." He shoves Dain into his room again, "And take a Godscursed bath, you reek."  

---

  
    
"What the actual fuck Aetos." Matthias grits, her hands hovering above his face, "What happened?"    
    
As Cath would say, its before the sun.    
    
Fourth and Second Wing are preparing to leave for Aretia. The rumors about his father beating the piss out of him have already made their rounds through the college, and even if they hadn't, it shows. The left side of his face is busted and split, to include his eyelid and eye, which is a deep maroon besides the top when he looks left or right. His nose is painfully, obviously broken, and he still feels sick. Every cough, every sniffle, every roll of nausea makes pain shoot like crossbolts through his nervous system. The thundering migraine he's had since Signet Sparring is ever present and makes him sensitive to every sense he has.    
    
_"Will you be upset if I fall asleep."_ he asks Cath out of respect; dragon appearances and all.    
    
_"You need to."_ Cath grumbles low in his throat, out loud, and Matthias eyes snap up to is swordtail, her hands drop to her sides.    
    
"You should see Nolon before we-,"    
    
"No." Dain starts, clearing his throat, "I'm fine." He absolutely would never let Nolon touch him again, even though he's having difficulties moving, standing, seeing even. His head swims. He'd rather die. Let his father beat him senseless.    
    
"Can you get in the seat? You look like you're gonna keel over." Sawyer says, then he flinches, "Oh."  Sawyer looks up at Cath, furrowing his brow, "Sorry, Cath."    
    
_"I'm sorry... I'll probably n-"_    
    
Cath stalks off farther down the field where no dragon, rider, or flier gathers before spreading his wings to their full height and length, he fans them out across the field and tips down his right one. He's magnificent, a living carving of garnet, it’s almost as if he's painted in blood that never dries. His scales raise and set along the vertebrae of the wing, and Dain sees the thinner membrane harden. Dain manages the steep incline of his wing well enough, stumbling a bit and almost losing his footing when Cath's tail sweeps behind him, its a massive scaled wall that catches him and forces him to lean forward. He can’t see the riders’ eyes stretched wide at Cath’s show of assistance to him, the mouths hanging open in disbelief.  
    
_"Thanks."_    
    
Cath lifts his neck around so he can watch Dain step onto his back, then he snaps his wings close to his body, waiting for the rest of the Wing to mount. Fifteen minutes into the flight he's asleep, cocooned by Cath's magic that holds him firmly against his spine and keeps the wind out of his eyes, lulled at the steady altitude he keeps to Aretia.    
    
Cath keeps them suspended above the valley when they arrive. Dain wakes up a few times during the flight, but is otherwise dead to the world. He catches glimpse of Thoirt and Sloane close by for just a moment, and hears Cath speaking to the other red in his mind but he's too tired to even wonder what they might be talking about. When they do finally descend, it’s in the courtyard of Riorson House. Cath rushes Dain inside and takes off as soon as he's in the fortress. Relief washes over both dragon and rider as he eyeballs the double-stairs from the Great Hall. Four flights later and he's sidling against the wall to his room for support.    
    
"Holy shit Aetos."    
    
His roommate runs to his side when he opens their door.    
    
"Have you seen the healers? Brennan?" his voice cracks with concern, he's dyed his hair dark green. Weird.    
    
"No, need sleep." Dain manages.    
    
He definitely doesn't ask for help from Troy to remove his clothes but he does anyway.    
    
"What happened?" the flier asks, pulling at the neck of Dain's undershirt so it doesn't slide across his face as he removes it.    
    
Dain manages to shake his head, then fumbles with the buttons of his pants, dropping them and kicking them off and slumping down onto the edge of the small bed.    
    
When he wakes up, its sluggishly, and he bring his hands to his face, no longer feeling the throbbing swelling of broken skin from his father’s rampage. His nose feels fine, and his eyes are no longer swollen shut. Brennan must’ve mended him. His eyes burn as he allows them to fall open; sleep has crusted his eyelids together and cured into a sickly, dried paste that he has to pick at with his fingernails.

_“You rise.”_ Cath grumbles through the bond, _“You are requested in the Duchess’s presence tonight.”_

Dain stretches, notices his shirt has been removed and glances over at where Troy could be, but is not.

_“Tairn?”_ He might be healed but his face and head still feel like shit. Thankfully he isn’t being plagued by Cath’s magic in addition. For now, anyway.

_“Yes.”_

Of course Tairn would pass along the word, Violet surely isn’t walking up to dragons and demanding their riders show up. He showers and changes into flight leathers. Aretia is oddly cold tonight and he grabs his fur lined jacket before tugging on his boots and tucking the laces. He hasn’t the patience to bother with proper appearances.

Riorson house is crawling with cadets and civilians alike. He watches them watch _him_ as his boots thump heavily through the halls, and when he reaches the assembly chamber he knocks before peering through the gap of the double-doors and letting himself inside. Violet and her crew, including the first years, are all seated on the opposite side of the room. When he walks in and closes the doors behind him he feels as though he’s on trial, his eyes lock on Sloane’s blue ones and he forces himself to look away.

"Feeling better?" Violet asks,

"Yes." he lies,

Violet smiles brightly, “You got Sloane to train her signet.”

His vision bounces to her but she’s looking away, her thin neck trained at something more interesting next to Lynx. Dain glances down at his boots then back up a Violet; he can’t find a reason for this intermission, he could’ve been sleeping.

He shrugs at Violet and she frowns.

“What’s going on with you? You’ve been sick constantly?"

“I’m fine.” He blurts, he shuffles backwards a bit, this isn’t a conversation he feels like having. It’s coming across as some strange intervention, Dain doesn’t need intervening, "It's nothing to worry about."

"You're not fine." she says, narrowing her eyes as her body becomes rigid, "You aren't fine and your father shouldn't be putting his hands on you like that."

"And who's gonna stop him? I'll just deal with it, there's only a few weeks left till graduation if this is how he wants to deal with me." Dain scoffs, rolling his neck, "It's probably just the surmounted disappointment after all these years of me being subpar."

She walks forward, slamming her hands onto the assembly table, "If this is happening now imagine what he'll do during War Games."

"I know this. But thankfully I'm the only one he seems to be concerned with Vi. I've never been beat for missing formation and class but apparently I'm receiving that level of scrutiny." He says plainly.

"That's absolutely not how we're going to handle this." She snips, "What he's doing is considered retaliation and we have immunity orders."

"Yes," Dain agrees, then condescendingly adds, "And he is General Aetos. Just leave it be. You're trying to be everywhere at once and you need to focus on retrieving Riorson and protecting civilians. It makes no sense to waste time worrying about me."

"Its not a waste of time to worry about my best friend!" she practically screams, and tears dot her waterline, "I'm sorry I casted you aside but it was clear to me where you stood and now that you've redefined those lines I feel like we should be able to recover our relationship, and even if we don't there's no way I'm going to let your dad beat you like he used to. Imagine what mine would say to him if he found out?!"

_Like he used to._

Varrish used to call him a _master of memories._ It took him only months to go unaffected by the remembrances of others. Took him seconds to blanket heated emotions that were inevitably pulled into him with their sentiments. His own he voided from existence, and he did it well, almost as if they never had in the first place.

"He used to beat me?" He repeats to Violet, his hands catching the table as he falls forward, forcing him to place his palms against it for stability.

He groans as a putrid wash of magic slams into him like a boulder and leaves him staggering for the assembly table. Xaden Riorson’s memories file through him like razor blades and glass shavings, and they’re v_ividly_ painful and detailed. His feelings, his desperation and the fucking fear that sucks the remaining air out of Dain’s lungs. His duty that leaves him virtually enslaved to Tyrrendor even as a child. He sat here, at this table, and fucking cried. Alone, for hours. He sees the marked ones at Basgiath, their expectant stares, watches them fall to their deaths at parapet, spends sleepless nights training them to get them ahead. He sees Violet in every instance that she graces him, she’s his solace and he’s losing himself right before her. She’s like a breath of warm air in the mornings, she washes through him effortlessly and pleasantly and he can find the reason to push on another Godsforsaken day. She treats him like he’s human, like he’s some random civilian and not his father’s son. Gods she _loves_ me. Grief like he’s never imagined it rips through Dain’s chest and he shakes for breath, tears sting against his eyes. What’s the point in living if it can’t be for her?

_“Be still.”_ Cath mutters,

“Cath—,”

He wipes his nose again. 

_What the hell?_

He glances down at the back of his hand eyes flaring wildly at the sight of his blood, it’s all over the floor, his uniform, probably smeared across his face and splattered all over the table. 

“I don’t know. I don’t know what’s wrong.” He shoves the memories away, forgetting their details almost instantaneously as he unintentionally speaks to Cath out loud.

“Are you sick?” She asks, eyebrows raised in undeniable shock,

“No. It’s just… Cath. We’re fine. We’ve been worse.”

She just _stares_ at him. Doesn't mention him talking about his dad in their past. Nothing.

“I realize that while I was holding my grudges against you I was also disregarding you. Entirely.” Violet look uncomfortable. Her eyes are almost completely green, and they seem genuine, and lost.

“It doesn’t matter.” He clips, reaching behind himself for the door handle.

“Stop being emotional for one second—,” Matthias begins, standing up between Ridoc and Sawyer,

“Stop pretending _you_ care.” He shouts, “You all have each other, enjoy it.” He points to Violet, “If it's just me, the squad survives and they go through their third year relatively peacefully while he harasses me in Navarre, one death for the—,”

Cath pitches a horrifying shriek from above Riorson House that sounds like anything besides what he is. Collectively their heads snap upwards,

“What in the fuck was that?” Baylor shudders.

_“You will not make light of your existence to others."_ he grumbles, anger smothers the bond and Dain’s headache worsens, but he manages to shield the brunt of it out.

“Fuck off Cath!!” He groans, he would rip his hair out if he could, as the headache ripples though his face and against his teeth like a cavity.

_“Do not disregard me Dain Aetos!”_ Cath threatens, and it’s no longer anger that drowns them—it’s fear and desperation. 

“I’m gonna grab you a rag man,” Ridoc says, “please sit down.”

“I think we all should… reacquaint ourselves. Properly. As a unit.” Violet begins when the doors click closed behind Dain, she’s fighting hard to maintain her calm demeanor but every syllable the facade fades and by the time her sentence finishes, she’s leaning towards him like she’ll catch him if he keels over. He doesn’t have it in him to fight anymore.

“I’ve been worried about you. And I’m not really sure how to approach you anymore,” she admits, “I’m not sure how to—”

“Don’t.” He mutters, “Just don’t. I looked into your mind thinking I had a right to your autonomy and decisions. Wanting to move past it doesn’t change that it happened.”

“This isn’t how Xaden would want us to operate.” She finishes.

“Xaden almost died alongside Liam because I—,”

“Because of your _father_. Who you trusted.” Sloane barks, her hair is loose from any binds and tumbles across her shoulders and down the back of her chair, “You didn’t make the decision that sent my brother to Malek. Stop trying to claim the credit of others.”

“And what the fuck are _we_ doing?” his attention shifts to Sloane and his anger spikes again, he hates when she ignores him. It’s make him want to…

_“Be still."_ Cath warns, his own anger is still bleeding out of the bond,

“What?” She says and leaves her mouth hanging open,

“You, me.” He says plainly, pointing at her then himself, “Let me guess—,”

“Shut your fucking mouth.” She snarls, anger glazes over her ice blue irises, “Do not.”

Dain bites the inside of his cheek. He wants to jump across the table and smash his mouth against hers. Fucking _brat_.

“They’re trying to apologize to you.” Cat begins, her silk voice carrying through the chamber, “I’m not sure why riders act like problems will just go away if they don’t face them. You’re a wingleader, you should know unit cohesiveness is tied directly into proper communication amongst yourselves.”

“Yes Cat, you’re correct,” Ridoc returns with a rag and hands it to Dain with a weak smile before he returns to his seat next to Sawyer, “I don’t really feel like opening up right now though. I appreciate the effort. Respectfully.”

He wipes his face off and watches Violet grimace, “So when and how do we resolve this… environment we’ve created?”

“After War Games. When I get my Wing through. We can go somewhere and talk, properly.”

“So you want me to wait to recover our relationship until after you’ve picked Draithus or some other suicide outpost as your duty station in hopes that you’ll die before we talk properly.” She rolls her eyes,

“No.” He sighs, even though it didn’t sound like a bad idea, “That might be what it seems like but I promise you that’s not what this is.”

“Then what is it?” Matthias glowers, “You can’t hate yourself forever.”

Dain clicks his tongue, “I can.”

“Aetos—,”

“I have some things I need to figure out with my dad and Cath first.” He grinds out unwillingly, “Something is just… wrong. So let me get my head on straight and I’ll be around.”

Violet shoots up from her seat, throwing her hands up, “You’ll ‘be around’,” she parrots incredulously as her mouth draws to a tight line, “I think now is a great time since you’re already here.”

“What do you want from me?!” It takes so much self control to not scream at her again, “What should I say? What can I say that I haven’t tried to say? You told me to fuck off last time I tried to apologize and—,”

“And I was wrong! I shouldn’t have done that!” She covers her face with her hands, “Dain, things are happening so fast right now and this whole time I wasn’t thinking about anyone except for Xaden. And the boundary you crossed made me such a huge liability to him.” Her eyes start to well up and his stomach twists. She takes a deep breath and balls her fists at her sides,

“All I’ve done is disregard the people around me and that’s not how I want to continue my life. Not when everything changes so...”

He looks away.

“Three weeks ago I dragged my whole squad half way across the world to selfishly seek a cure for the love of my life. I got lucky and managed to solve the Aretian Ward issue at the same time but the truth is,” she gasps as the tears stream down her face and Matthias grabs her hand, “I couldn’t have cared less honestly. All I wanted was _Xaden_ fixed.”

She shoves the words across the room like rotting carcasses. She’s disgusted with herself.

“Now I have the one thing he existed for and I don’t know what the fuck I’m doing and I find myself regretting how I’ve treated you and so many others because I’m fucking scared. And I want and need your help, and your opinions, and your guidance.”

Dain holds up his hands, “You can’t trust me anymore Vi.”

Cath prickles.

“I don’t need to touch you to read your memories anymore. And I plan on turning myself in our rotation back to Basgiath.”

“The fuck you will!” She screams at him, her eyes phase amber, “Absolutely not, _they’ll kill you!!_”

For the first time, Iron Squad aggressively fights in his favor.
