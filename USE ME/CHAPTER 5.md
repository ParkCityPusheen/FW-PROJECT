### [Chapter 5](https://archiveofourown.org/works/63478354/chapters/163144411): Dain | Considerations

They're all in the valley above Riorson House when Sloane reproduces the control daggers. Sawyer, the other first years, and Matthias aren't here, but Violet has made a point to show up.

"This is the receive and amplify runed dagger that I imbued Ridoc's magic into." Sloane is telling her, "I'm going to have him use it."

Ridoc is bouncing around on his heels, "This is gonna be revolutionary."

"Well..." Violet thinks aloud, her mind working for predictions already, "We know that the alloy hilted daggers are an imbued, concentrated extension of the wards' magic,"

"Wait do we?" Ridoc pauses, "I thought they were just a imbued with _secret_ magic."

"How they're imbued is classified, there's a special alloy embedded into it's hilt, and it's also runed." She continues, "It's not all the same combination, so I wonder what'll happen here."

"Maybe this being an untampered metal will cause problems..." Dain muses, scratching at his beard. He wonders for a moment if his signet will activate at the onslaught of information, and he tenses.

"I wasn't thinking about that. Professor Trissa did say the medium you pick matters." Violet agrees, nodding at him and he remembers Trissa's runes nearly burning through the wooden disks as she explained the process to them.

Sloane hands Ridoc the dagger.

"Okay so just... throw it?" He asks,

"I mean, yeah." Sloane says, she rolls her shoulder at an attempted show of indifference but Dain sees through it and can tell she's petrified for the results. 

He scribbles away at his notebook: _dagger is plain, forged metal, no special medium (like the metal meant for venin daggers), only two runes._

Ridoc stretches obnoxiously before pinching the dagger tip and swinging his forearm out, launching it down the valley. They're focused like bird-watching cats, expectations beyond them. It explodes in the distance after the tip collides with the grassy valley floor, erecting an iceberg the size of Andarna in its wake, he can feel the breeze become colder as the wind blows around it and onto them, and they share the same dropped-jaw response.

"No fucking way." Dain gapes, "Mairi! This is..." he can't help grinning in her direction, "This is insane." He watches in disbelief as she turns her chin up before grimacing in disgust at him, blushing deeply.

He pauses at the sight of her, relishing in it. She's wearing their summer flight leathers, casually armed with half an arsenal's worth of daggers, all with jeweled hilts. Her twin plaits are perfectly symmetrical and braided tight against her scalp, they flirt in the mountain breeze, and dance wildly down around her waist. She's standing just ahead of the iceberg and the sun's light beams through it against her, lighting her up like a rare display, presenting her no less than the gilded queen she is to him, standing proud and unmovable before her handy work.

"Wait is this real?" Ridoc bursts, he's elated for Sloane and the utilization of his magic, "Let's go check it out!"

He and Sloane make their way towards it, then Imogen, Cat, and Maren. Dain and Violet proceed at the tail end.

"A few days ago when we were talking," She begins cautiously as they fall instep with each other, and out of range of the others, "I mentioned our dads... and you said you didn't remember what I was talking about?"

"I don't." He admits, he spent a few nights looking for memories of his childhood but all he could gain were training, performing, and reporting. Outside of his memories with the Sorrengail's, his childhood was hardly childlike. The only time he laughed was with Violet and her family. All the other times... the emotions were empty and cold. Absent.

"You don't remember the first time our dads had a fight?" she prods, quietly and bares a look of disgust that tells him she doesn't want to talk about any of this.

"I don't." He mutters, he searches her face for eye contact, he wants her to feel his desperation; he wants her to see it.

When she stops he does as well, right by her side, as he always has. Her emotions run rampant across her face and her hazel eyes swim,

"Dain." she rubs her face, "Is there anything else you don't remember?"

"My mom. My childhood?" he blurts, "I remember the times I was stationed around your family mostly but outside of that, and the times in-between... there's nothing."

She looks torn at the admission, "You never talked about her so I don't..."

"I know. My dad never did either." he searches around his mind, "But I remember at least having inklings... irrelevant, fleeting memories of her. Like how she smelled, and the tone of her voice, but now there's nothing."

"Maybe your signet getting more powerful is the reason, but why a whole chunk of your life?"

"Powerful?" He mimics sarcastically, "More like uncontrollable."

"But there's balance, in our signets." she presses, mostly convincing herself, "Even within ourselves."

He cocks a brow at her, "How is there balance in yourself with a signet like your own?"

"I can't aim still," she starts, eyes skirting down the valley,

"Vi—that just sounds like a personal skill cap."

She scoffs and flicks him off, "Yeah okay asshole, you're probably right."

He can't help laughing with her, "On a serious note though, there's a lot of unexplained things happening." he sighs and looks above to the sky where Thoirt and Cath break through towering clouds.

"Nothing makes sense Vi. Literally _nothing_ makes any fucking sense and it's driving me insane that no one cares to..."

He trails off at the notion that she might actually let him go permanently after this conversation.

"Tell me." she says, taking a step towards him, "Tell me what you're thinking."

"Vi, aren't you guys gonna check this out!?" Ridoc calls, his brown hair tousling in the wind.

"We will, give us a sec." She tells him, raising her hand, then she turns back to Dain, her silver coronet braid shines like halo, _"Where's your head at?"_

Dain pulls his shoulders. They hadn't shared a proper moment in ages. Maybe it was time to just jump the boundary hurdle and create new ones with hope as a guide. He looks down at his best friend, and he decides then he trusts her, and that resolve never waivered for a moment all this time. He can feel her concern for him in the growing tension between them.

"Where should I start?" He exhales, "My perspective is skewered and probably shouldn't be repeated. But I'll tell you if that's what you need."

She crosses her arms and closes her eyes as a warm wind blows over them; she's adopted Riorson's habit, "Start where its comfortable for you."

"None of this is comfortable." he croaks, his voice wavers like bending branches and threatens to crack under his heavy emotions,  

She couldn't possibly understand the amount of things clicking in his mind since their visit to the Isles, the reading of classified materials, the uncovering of wyvern and venin. Dain's world had been turned inside out and effectively upside down. No question was a dumb one, and any presumption could be considered.

"What causes you the most discomfort then?" Violet presses, her brows knitting.

"Cath." He lets his gaze rise to his bond, he's a red dot in the sky above them. 

Her head jerks upward in unguarded surprise; he can tell she wasn't considering his swordtail as a topic of discussion, "What about him?"

"He's not normal. He knows it. I know it. We know it. But we don't talk about it and he _won't_ talk about it."

There's a threatening, uncomfortable pause and he wonders if Tairn is listening in, that she might even be telling him.

She breathes in deeply as if it'll ease the awkwardness, then asks in a gently persuading tilt, "What isn't normal about him?"

"His magic. Its fundamentally _wrong_ and I can't explain that, because I haven't even figured out why its wrong, I can only feel it—why Sloane get's sick whenever she siphons our magic without imbuing it." The confession falls from his lips like a hex; he doesn't mean Cath is wrong for existing in anyway, but he's never talked about it to anyone. And he certainly hadn't expected it to be Violet.

Worse than anything, it feels like he's denouncing the swordtail, and he would never. His life meant nothing in light of what Cath's does to him.

"He _sounds_ different, the noises he makes scare me down in my bones; they make some deeply ingrained flight-or-fight response I have activate and its horrifying. He disappears for days sometimes, he doesn't tell me where he's gone, no hints, nothing. And he treats me like I'm some precious gem."

Her eyes narrow and she leans forward in comical disbelief, "You are, you're his rider. And they're a different species of course the sound weird."

"No. Would Tairn ever extend his wing for you, let alone another person? Get upset whenever you shield him out? Talk to you until you fall asleep?" He presses urgently and glances up at Cath, squinting against the sunlight, he wants this part of their conversation to end quickly.

"I... don't know." She admits, her feet shuffling, "Probably not."

"Exactly my point. Cath does not give a single fuck what the other dragons think about him and I mean that in the most literal sense that I can convey with words. He doesn't concern himself with elders, doesn't care about the nesting grounds, doesn't care about how he's perceived, just _me_. If there are consequences regarding anything about me, he'll risk it all. Even other dragons." He pauses, watching as she soaks it in, "As for sounds? Next time Cath makes a warning or distress sound I want you to really, really focus on it."

"Sounds like you're treasured. Gem. Like you said." Violet lifts her chin at him like Sloane had just moments ago,

He shakes his head in frustration, "Another thing—,"

"Wait, dial it back." she cuts him off and raises her hand at him, "Sloane gets sick when she siphons from you?"

"Yes."

"She was fine after she saved Mira."

"Yes, she was." he nods, "But when she trains with me and attempts to imbue our magic, specifically when she just siphons from me, she gets sick. Nolon said 'withdrawal like symptoms'."

Violet tilts her head, "What the fuck."

"Also, venin."

"Xaden?" she spits, eyebrows raising.

"No. I mean maybe? I don't know, he might still be himself. But, to what end do they channel? They just keep channeling, and channeling, and channeling until fucking what? Suck the planet dry and no one survives, or can survive, because that makes a lot of sense."

She freezes.

"That never crossed your mind?" He blanches, "It never plucked a string that they're just going with no means to an end? And the Irids. So they're magic, they're their own magic—no need to channel, and when the world is emptied of it all, they still exist?" He throws his hands up, "Do we really even understand magic?"

"You've been thinking about things from a perspective—,"

"That is foundationally wrong. You know, my dad said something to me after he was done beating me," her body goes taught with frustration at the mention of the abuse, "he called Cath a freak. _A freak of a dragon._ What did Cath do to him for dad to call him a freak? He lied to me my whole life about the world outside of Basgiath and military games, which I found out by violating your trust, and called my dragon a _freak_. I've concluded everything I think I know is a lie to an unfortunate extent. The world is not black and white like the Codex. It's mostly grey and confusing."

Violet waits for him to finish.

"And for powerful, magic-wielding beings that 'don't answer to puny humans' dragon's are certainly involved in our puny lives. They're dying with us on their backs, playing as operators in our war plans and battle tactics. Risking death bonding with human children at a college meant to produce killing machines when they could just, I don't know, _not_ do that?"

Her eyes search his face, and he's not sure what she's questing for. He wonders if that look she gives him is one of sympathy because she realizes he's finally lost his mind, or if she really just hadn't considered these obvious things.

"Violet, we're chasing the wrong questions, trusting the wrong voices, and searching for answers where they can't be found."

"So we jump off the deep end with conspiracies?" She says mildly.

Her body language tells him that she really _hears_ him, that she's objectively considering the things he's saying, but that it's a lot. He continues.

"No but, I think a normal rider would just accept that Cath is different. Write it off as the business of dragons. But if we flip this, and consider that Cath might be the only dragon we can actually trust because he _is_ strange, like Andarna, doesn't that immediately fork paths in directions that weren't there before? And maybe he's so fond of me because dragons do answer to humans, or _did_ at one point. What if the Irids are right to want us to die out?"

"That can't possibly be what you're saying we should do." She huffs.

"No, but, why are they so different from our own dragons and when did they become so novel, and what do we need to do to fix ours?"

"You think our dragons are... wrong?"

"They told us they were, right there on the beach Vi. But I can't prove the Irids are the right or wrong way either."

He takes a deep breath.

"Please remember you're an ungraduated duchess now and there's more important things to consider here like the province, Cath's magic might just be making me crazy... I'm purposefully looking at things in ways I've been fixed not to."

"No. What you have to say is _important,_ Dain." she looks down the valley at the half melted iceberg, where Sloane is watching them with narrowed eyes, "I just didn't know you had so much to say. We're going to need to start taking note of these things, this is really a lot to digest."

"I think the most unsettling part of all of this is that Cath knows I'm thinking these things. I think them loudly. And he doesn't correct or scold me; I can feel him there, in my mind, just listening. He's doing it now and we won't have a word about it later."

Violet slowly looks up to the swordtail circling above them and then back at Dain, her face markets her shock; she's been shielding out her own dragons, "You didn't shield him out this whole time?"

"No. Why should I? He lives in my head, and has been my only friend for years. I trust him wholly and inherently, and I don't keep things from people I love." he deadpans, looking at her with a shock stricken face,

Her eyes bare the hint of tears when she looks away from Cath and then to Dain, she offers him a horribly sorrowful smile, "I'm sorry I've been so... tunnel visioned."

She wipes her face and develops an undeniable facade of control and calm as they approach the others. Imogen meets them halfway with extended arms, carrying a cracked and jagged material that glints in the sunlight as she walks towards them.

"Look at this," she begins as they reach her simultaneously, "I was thinking the dagger turned into the ice, but it shattered."

Dain frowns in thought, "So it hit ground and Ridoc's magic was released instantaneously."

"No," Violet dissents, "I think if it had been instant the second he willed it, the ice would have exploded through it while he held it in his hand."

"Did you activate the rune before you threw the dagger?" Dain asks Ridoc.

"I imagined it being an attack with my signet before I launched it, but I'm not sure if that's activating it." He shrugs,

"You willed it." Cat says monotonously, "So yes, its just semantics. Activating and willing runes to work are more or less the same thing."

"So Sloane could make us an armory of signet loaded weapons?" Ridoc ponders, scratching his palms.

"No." Dain admonishes him curtly, "We absolutely do not tell anyone what Mairi is capable ofc,"

"Why?" Sloane interrupts, she steps towards Dain and into Violet's space, "I trained my signet, this is useful and _powerful_."

"Absolutely fucking not." Dain spits, his tone leaves no room for argument and he takes a step forward himself, "Have you not realized there's a commonly reoccurring theme here with signets and the extent of our capabilities?"

"Are you upset that I could kill people as well as Violet? Enjoy interrogation rooms while I save lives Aetos." she barks, lifting her chin in disgust,

"Are you kidding me?" He chides, "Do you ever hear yourself speak? You just—,"

"Stop it." Violet hisses, shoving his chest, "Sloane we can't trust Basgiath, so while the recognition would be nice, it's better to keep this to amongst us, he's not trying to be a dick."

"She doesn't care. She only ever considers herself." he barks, rebuking her insults with a swift turn, Cath lands and he stalks off towards him, irritated.

"He's trying to protect you, I promise." he hears Violet continue as he rushes off and he wants to yell in agreeance.

What would it take for her to understand him? They need her. She is who magic has chosen. She is _life_. 

---

"Coming to eat?"

It's Cat. Banging on his door just before the floor aide rings the meal bell.

"Do I get to say no?" he scowls through the crack in the door he's graced her with.

"No."

"Gods." he curses, "Let me put my boots on."

He turns to close the door but she shoves her foot in the opening and kicks it the rest of the way, he moves to say something but shrugs when she enters the room, and she doesn't shut it behind her.

"Catriona?" Troy says from his bed where he's been reading quietly,

"Are you reading the fucking Codex?" Cat shrieks, "What has he done to you?"

Dain looks up from his laces to Troy, "What?"

"Well, we're at their death factory of a school. And they only consider right and wrong when it comes to this damn thing so... better to read it." Troy tells her begrudgingly.

Cat rolls her eyes.

"Ready?" Dain asks her before strutting out of the room without looking back.

"You know," she begins once she's at his side while they descend the steps, "I've been saying you need to talk to your squad, but maybe you should talk to Sloane specifically."

"Why's that." he snorts, "Wouldn't change anything, I'll be out of her hair in a few weeks."

"She's like a cat."

"No, you're Cat." he deflects.

He knows Sloane is like a cat, he doesn't need Cat to tell him that. Sloane is quick to temper, quick to cuddle, quick to feign interest. And he doesn't need Cat to suggest what he needs to do about her, he knows what Sloane needs.

"You make jokes?" she remarks, "Maybe don't anymore."

He flinches; what a bitch.

"Anyway," she continues, picking at her nails as they press onwards, "I personally feel like she wanted you to praise her, considering you've put the most interest into her training."

"What? When, today? In the valley?"

"Yes."

They're at the foot of the last set of stairs when he stops to ponder what Cat's saying.

"She wants me to praise her so she attacks me when I don't?"

"Are you a virgin?" She suddenly insists, "You sound like one."

Behind them a group of riders snicker.

His eyes sharpen on her as they take a place in line, "Do you talk to me for conversation or just to insult me?"

If he didn't know any betetr he'd of been balls deep in her the day he saved her without a doubt, and she probably needed the sex more than him with the way she was talking and sticking around him more since. His face twitches as the realization dawns on him.

Was Cat hanging around for something?

"Men are so fucking emotional." She cringes, "Personally I've heard your lore and it's not as deep as everyone is making it out to be. I think you're someone we should utilize and depend on more. Proxy hunting you is boring."

"Funny you think the complete opposite of my own people." he quips, hands twitching.

"You could tone down the whole.... wingleader thing."

"Trust me, I have. I pray the day that the title leaves me comes quick, fast, and in a hurry."

"And what do you do after that?" Cat chimes, pushing her plate forward for pork.

"Protect and serve—with a wingleader medal." He scoffs, saluting her with his plate of lamb.

She rolls her eyes this time.

They eat dinner in silence, to Dain its nice, undoubtedly comforted to have someone there with him whether they speak or not. Especially after seeking him out for it. She eats as gracefully as she looks, and he finds himself wondering if she's properly grieved Traeger's death. At the thought she suddenly doesn't look as put together as she carries herself. She looks absolutely drained.

"Can you feel that?" She asks suddenly, poking at potatoes on her plate.

"Feel what?"

"That burn?"

His brows fly up, "Burn? You need to see the healers, can't help you, sorry."

Her mouth falls open, "Aetos you fucking prick, no." she remarks loudly, laughing when a chuckle rumbles through him.

"I mean you said it." he jokes, shaking his head, his shoulders bouncing.

"You're being watched." she says lowly, leaning towards him.

He stiffens. _Freezes._

"Keep chewing Aetos."

He does.

"It's just Sloane, relax."

"Why not say that first Cat? Shit." he exhales and sets his utensils down.

"Who else could it be?" she shakes her head at him,

"What do you mean who else? My father?"

She grimaces, "Let's not manifest that. Anyway, no. It's our favorite blonde first year who watches you like a sentry and she does a horrible job at trying to hide it."

"She's trying to get the right angle to launch her fork between my eyes." he mutters.

"She certainly wants you at an angle." Cat practically purrs.

He glances up at her and shivers when he sees a self-satisfied grin grow across her face. Dread begins to bloom in mind. That's the same conniving look she'd get after fucking with Violet's head.

"What?" He says in disbelief, "What are you getting at?"

"Please make an inference." She growls, running a hand down her face.

"Are you... stirring up trouble? Don't, for the love of Loial." he begs,

"Aetos."

Its Sloane. She stands at the edge of their table with her fingers laced together, she doesn't acknowledge Cat at all, only Dain. Panic stirs in the depths of her azure irises,

"Can I speak with you?" she asks, shifting around uncertainly.

"Cat." he implores,

Cat looks up at the ceiling then back down at Dain before removing herself from the table and gesturing for Sloane to sit, "Like a cat." she coos quietly as she passes around him while running a finger along the expanse of his back. She doesn't leave him there with Sloane though; she sits _right next to him_ and resumes eating.

When he looks up to acknowledge Sloane she looks enraged, she stands behind where Cat was, directly ahead of him, and glares down at them.

"Mairi." he says, once she's seated.

"Good evening." she blurts awkwardly.

Dain lifts a doubtful brow.

"Look," she begins, "I wanted to apologize for what I said to you earlier. Violet told me I was being unreasonable."

"Heard." he recites, chewing his food.

She gapes, then slams her mouth shut, "That's it?"

He gestures with his fork while speaking, "Apology given, apology accepted. Thank you."

"I don't want to fight with you." she declares.

He looks up at her and sees oddly placed solemn in her features.

"Okay." he snipes, "What _do_ you want?"

"I want us to get along."

Get along? He wonders what that all entails, but doesn't say it out loud. He risks a glance at Cat and she's not looking at them but her brows tell another story.

"Okay. Be respectful. I'll consider it a start."

"I can't be respectful when you speak to me like a dick." she snaps, shifting her weight along her hips,

"Me? A dick." He jeers, "You come over here while I'm eating with company to deliver a shitty apology on someone else's behalf for the way _you_ acted? Checks out."

"Who cares that someone is finally hanging around you." Sloane taunts, she seems like she's shaking a bit and serves up her nastiest glare to Cat; but to him, it's Cat's default facial expression.

"Obviously you, since you felt like you needed to try and chase them away so you could piss off right after." he grinds out the snarky remark, picking up his plate, "Don't worry, I'll head out, since I'm inconveniencing you by sharing a common space."

"Wait." she croaks, face painted scarlet. 

"What, Mairi, for fucks sake." he sighs, standing up, his head cranes backwards against his shoulders.

"If you guys are fucking and I'm getting in the way, just say that!" She barks, throwing her hands against the table. It makes the other patron's dinnerware clatter against the wood and the dining hall becomes horrendously quiet. 

He closes his eyes and breathes deeply.

Dain drops his plate of unfinished food and grabs her arm, pulling her in close, "Walk." he seethes through gritted teeth after shoving her towards the dinner line, "Hall, _now_."

He's a bit surprised when she turns tail and walks out of the mess hall without arguing but the suffocating irritation remains that she just fucking blared that accusation across the damn room. He can feel every watchful gaze on his person as he swaggers out behind her after placing his plate in the return bin. He catches Cat, relocated, a few tables away from the exit with Maren now, she's got her thin fingers placed over her mouth with that fucking shit-eating grin plastered across her face. She raises her brows in surprise at him then turns away to speak to Maren.

This. _Bitch_.

They haven't quite reached a private place to talk but it doesn't matter at this point.

"Who I'm sleeping with is none of your fucking business." He snarls once Sloane stops walking and turns to face him, "I get it, you hate me. I'm a murderer. But don't go out screaming stupid shit. Imagine what she might have to deal with under the pressure of stupid assumptions."

For some reason she looks like she wants to cry.

"I don't hate you!!" she manages, "It's just you never hang around Cat!"

He shakes his hands in disbelief between them, "And?!"

He can tell Cat's mind work is rooted deeply and razing through her thought processes.

"Sloane what did you want to say?" He urges, "Think clearly and say it, I have to be up early."

"I'm sorry." she breathes out heavily, "I'm sorry I made you feel like I was coming on to you."

He nods slowly, "Me too. Please, don't be late to formation tomorrow morning."

He walks away with the most disgusting feeling of confusion. He has every right to be upset. He has every right to stand up for Cat against rumors that Sloane may or may not be intentionally spreading. He picks at his cuticles till they bleed and stares at the entryway of the fourth floor's left wing. He can't get the sight of her quivering in front of him out of his mind. He's got every pore on her skin, every lash above her eyes, and every stray hair above her forehead ingrained in his thoughts. Even with the growing dislike he's developing for her he can't fight wanting to pull her against his body and caressing her until she smiles. Until her ocean eyes are still and warm and protected like the Vale. He could let Sloane commit foul crimes against him and comfort her for feeling guilty about it afterwards.

His emotions work so roughly Cath talks him to sleep that night.

---

Dain ends up in a strategic conference with a few of the assembly members and professors the next morning, Brennan and Kiandra steer the conversation for the most part. It's hypothetical and theoretical so there's not much to argue about. They want him to work on flier-rider relations, especially in the tactical sense after he and Cath's seamlessness in the valley. He agrees to helping as soon as he's formally asked, but he doesn't offer any input outside of that.

Ulices Ferris has words for him though.

"And why are _you_ here?" he asks neutrally, at first. Dain knows he means Tyrrendor

"Riorson and Violet." Dain deadpans.

It's easy to answer the "why" questions nowadays.

"What relation could you possibly have to Fen's son as the son of General Aetos."

Dain sighs and leans back in his chair, and the movement makes Ferris raise a brow, "I don't. I'm not his son."

"But you are."

"Not according to him. Which is fine with me." Dain shrugs.

He can tell Ferris doesn't care for personal opinions, so he doesn't bother embellishing. Brennan, who sits across from him looks intrigued.

Ferris snorts, "I suppose we look forward to your supplementary guidance with the fliers and riders. It's nice to see a young man who doesn't faulter... what made you change your mind about where you allegiances lie?"

"Hundreds of thousands of pointlessly dead civilians at the hands of a common enemy. Sending my best friend and her lover to their presumed deaths. Disowning me for choosing the right side? He's already a dead man."

"Hah!" Ferris leans in close, "And why is that?"

Dain turns to meet his gaze, casually placing his bicep across the table and bending his elbow, bringing his fist to rest against his cheek in a show of casual assurance,

"Nobody insults my fucking dragon, General Ferris."

General Suri speaks next, "Your Tyrrish is quite well. I appreciate you using it in this setting. Though you might be that prick's child, you certainly don't act like anything like him."

She carries the same air that Ferris does, no-nonsense and stubborn. He perplexes over how different the upper brass carries themselves in Tyrrendor; there's only morally based logic here, and it isn't grey. They don't flaunt and float around like their parallel's do at Basgiath.

"It's unfortunate you only inherited his genes." Ferris bites, "You're like a miniature fucking version of him."

"Thank you." Dain says in closing, to both of them.

"Dain's a good kid, he grew up with us. I'm glad he managed to pick the right side of all of this. Violet too." Brennan remarks proudly,

Ferris rolls his eyes so far back that he has to blink several times to recover.

"There's talks of adopting you as a Tyrrish Ambassador," Suri continues, never taking her eyes off of him, "I have reason to suggest you focus primarily on the fliers."

"I'll see it done." He declares, in perfected Krovlish. He doesn't let his surprise at her announcement show, but he could smile.

Suri turns to Brennan with a smirk, "Maybe I have underestimated the young Aetos."

"If only your sister showed the same promise." Ferris spits as he stands up, his chair screeching behind him, "I'm leaving. I'll be in the valley next week to observe the fruits of your labor, Aetos. If all goes well I would prepare yourself to call Tyrrendor home for the remainder of this war, should we survive it."

"Yes General." Dain says.

"Kiandra?" Suri transitions to the Cliffsbaine professor, turning to face her.

"Right," she passes out a hard cloth portfolio full of official military missives to each seated attendee, Dain's fingers tingle,

_"Purpose."_ Cath says sleepily in his mind,

_"You went back to sleep after you woke me up?"_ He asks the swordtail, as he thumbs through the documents,

_"Yes."_

Dain hums softly in response.

There's correspondence between King Tecarus, Cat, and Kiandra, then between King Tecarus and Brennan, it reads about the attempt in including drifts in riot flight formations and of Cath's and Dain's near perfect performance. Allegedly this this was the first attempt to be drafted, explained, and then preformed. The reason it hadn't been done before was simply because dragons would not participate, but now it seems a few more had been convinced.

_"Fun."_ Cath yawns.

Dain smirks.

"This is groundbreaking in a strategic sense. Considering the relationship between Navarre and Tyrrendor, and now Poromiel and Tyrrendor I believe this might be our edge going forward." Kiandra announces,

Dain isn't sure if he should be speaking but he does anyway, "Is this a fluid training plan?"

"In what way?" she asks, she looks surprised that he spoke up,

"Between the Aretian riot and Basgiath."

She pauses and glances at Suri, who nods.

"No."

"No?" Dain parrots.

"Only Aretian dragons and riders have agreed to participate in the new paradigms, and _only_ under the guidance of yourself and Cath."

He nods and paws through the documents more closely this time, at the middle of page ten in bold pressed ink: **Supervised by Cadet Dain Aetos and his Red Swordtail, Cath.** Beneath is a list of riders who volunteered in the evolutions. She continues after watching him comb through the parchment,

"There are other riders who are willing to participate after seeing the progress with this first group."

"And the fliers?" he inquires,

"The same who participated initially."

"Are the gryphons... accepting of this? The formations?"

She smiles brightly, "Thanks to you and your bond, yes."

He allows a breathy laugh to leave his nose and nods, "We look forward to it."

He finishes reading the document and pulls the dates and times for the practices in his own note book and leans back into his seat, listening intently about the safest possible formations to utilize gryphons and dragons together and _not_ Sloane's grassy scent or if her hip bones would feel as sharp as her insults..

Cath chortles.

After the meeting is adjourned he shakes hands with the higher ranking and waits respectfully for them to file out before leaving last.

"Sorry they sprung the ambassador thing on you." Brennan chuckles once he's out and closing the door, "I wanted to be the one to present that possibility to you,"

"It's fine; I want to be as far from Basgiath as I can be after graduation."

Brennan smiles, "Welcome to the club."

"I'm guessing I'm going to be in Poromiel quite a bit?" He grumbles somewhat sleepily,

Dain for Tyrrendor and Poromiel, and Aaric for Tyrrendor and Navarre. Violet would have eyes on all sides.

"Possibly." Brennan professes, shoving his hands in his pockets, "Have you eaten? You look like you could eat."

Around this time their first class would be ending, so breakfast was still being served for civilians and personnel who weren't Cadets. He wonders why everyone was so concerned about him eating suddenly.

_"I was asked by Fierge to hunt."_ Cath tells him,

_"Huh? Really? Did you go?"_ Dain's eyebrows lift.

_"I did."_ Cath admits, unintentionally bolstering Dain, since he usually operates alone.

He turns his head to Brennan, "I could eat."

Breakfast is eggs, Tyrrish hashed meat and potatoes, and a sweet yogurt.

"The food is so good here I don't get it." Dain says as he shovels it into his mouth. Even the coffee was better than the blackened, gritty shit he would drain down in Basgiath. It tasted the same way it smelled; rich and aromatic, smooth to go down and settled nicely in the stomach. He finished his coffee because he wanted to and not because he had the itching urge for caffeine like he did at the college.

"Well," Brennan begins, "Xaden's dad had this theory about good food and morale, preached it into the kid so much that agriculture was his main concern for the first three years after the man passed. But Riorson House is staffed with civilians and not Cadets, so the food is made with patience and experience, and it's usually fresh."

"I stand behind this theory." Dain says, gulping down his second cup of coffee. He notes the buttery blonde color of it, like a warmer version of Sloane's hair.

"Are you okay with instructing the flight formations?" Brennan asks him, scratching through his reddish curls, "I didn't ask about that either; I got excited when I heard about everything that happened and immediately wrote up a missive with Kiandra and had it sent out."

"Of course. But I worry about... I guess Basgiath catching wind of it."

"Don't," Brennan scoffs, "None of this will be of official business until after the trial run next week. After that we'll take it to the college, whether or not they want to incorporate it in the curriculum and as an official military tactic is up to them."

Dain pinches his brows together.

"And if they do, you'll be an instructor when you aren't out on official business. It's a safer environment for the fliers here."

His body relaxes.

"When did he... start doing this to you again?" Brennan asks, locking their eyes together with newfound concern as he shifts the conversation.

"The magic? After I came to Aretia the first time." Dain sputters,

"What? No not Cath, your dad hitting you." Brennan leans forward, "And the magic I felt while mending you, that wasn't..."

Dain rubs at his beard, "I mean, about my dad first. He used to do this to me often?"

Brennan grimaces, "You don't remember? All the times you stayed with us afterwards?"

"No."

He says it quickly. Whatever memories they had, he no longer did.

"Can I have them?" He asks Brennan softly, carefully.

"What? The beatings?"

"No you fucking idiot, the memories." Dain grits out,

"Gods, calm down I thought he really did a number on you this time." He laughs loudly, his amber eyes harden, "Are you sure though? It's my perspective so I'm not sure if it'll be helpful."

He nods, "I'm hoping they'll trigger something in me. I'm not sure why I'm missing memories."

"Alright." Brennan sighs, he suddenly looks tired, "Do you need me to like... lay on the floor or something?"

"No Brennan, just give me your wrist." he rolls his eyes,

When he rests his arm across their table in Dain's direction Dain takes a deep breath. He hadn't willingly looked at anyone's memories since Jack fucking Barlow and he shakes at the thought; he developed a habit of not looking at his arms because of the marks he left on him. It was repulsive.

"Alright. Good luck?" Brennan says, "Do I just stay here?"

"Yeah," he looks up at him, "I'll be honest it's been a while and my signet... it's evolving... so I don't know what'll happen—,"

He grabs Dain's hand, "I trust you." he says with a smile and a dismissive shrug.

His heart aches at how quickly Brennan says it, how quick he is to touch him, but his stomach plummets when he feels an alien prickle of worry from Cath in the wasteland that occupies their bond.

Dain exhales deeply, "Thank you Brennan."
