Absolutely! Based on your instructions, here's what you're looking for in my review and feedback:
Style Preferences:
Longer sentences are perfectly acceptable
Semi-colons are welcome
Avoid em dashes entirely
Avoid short, punchy sentences
Avoid overusing similes
Get creative with metaphors
Keep stylistic formatting parallel to your existing style
Review Focus:
Finalization rather than enhancement
Ensure the text fits with the existing narrative
Check that it flows smoothly
Verify it makes sense logically and contextually
Maintain consistency with your established voice and tone
What I should NOT do:
Suggest major stylistic changes
Recommend shorter sentences
Add em dashes
Over-simplify the prose
Suggest excessive simile usage
I'm ready to review your revised beginning paragraphs with these criteria in mind. Please share what you've revised so far, and I'll focus on ensuring it fits seamlessly with your established style while checking for flow, logic, and consistency.
