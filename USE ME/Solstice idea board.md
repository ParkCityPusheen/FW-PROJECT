its hard to fill the shoes of someone ive never been

DAIN READING IN THE DINING HALL WITH HIS GLASSES ON DURING DINNER HOURS AND ALL THE WING'S FEMALES ARE BASICALLY SITTING OPPOSIT OF HIM IN ONE ROW AND HE DOESN'T REALIZE IT AND SLOANE IS LIKE HELLOOOO SITUATIONAL AWARENESS??

Dain gets his medical status pulled: cleared for flight

Cath agrees to allow Thoirt and Sloane to watch them go deep sea fishing

They go to a stationary store at some point, and Sloane decides to hash out their relationship using the new pens and paper they have

They go to the stationary store because Sloane asks Dain for his notes from his second year and he also gives her his third year Journey Man (eq to a Travelers Journal) he tells her it's one of his most favorite hobbies, collecting pens, keeping notes, writing letters...

As it turns out he still writes to the girl he lost his virginity to (her name is Shepard. She inherited her family's farm, they raise Cattle) Cath likes cows....

She reads their messages, they're all factual and about livestock health and management, as well as financial literacy.

Shep writes about Cath,

They have a chart that looks like this:
**Things we need to talk about**

| Liam      | Liam                       |
| --------- | -------------------------- |
| I'm Venin | Can I tell people about us |
|           | Cath                       |
Sloane sits in for one of Dain's "Supplementary Sessions."
During these sessions he teaches the fliers what he knows about dragons, and Cath provides exposure of dragons to young gryphons, while the fliers train Dain in using runes and other things like... blood magic.

Dain gives Sloane the glaive they made for her (for him)

He shows her the plate armor that squadron wears, dragon scale armor all made from the scales of the reds in Cath's den. Paid for by Dain with a chunk of ruby he got from Cath and Dòrainn.

Dain tells Catriona about Sloane, she congratulates them.

Sloane spars with squadron. Radomirka invites her.

Sloane asks Dain who he lost his virginity to, discovers he's only been with three other women and has had sex enough time to count it on his fingers (holy shit)

**When they go fishing**

Dain sidles to Cath’s back, and when he’s throwing his harpoon/spear it’s from Cath’s tail, he secures a rope with a cloth buffer to his front foot, this way when he jumps in the water Cath can pull him right out, they normally collect their catches on a floating raft that Dain has built.
