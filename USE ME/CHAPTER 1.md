### [Chapter 1](https://archiveofourown.org/works/63478354/chapters/162656737): Dain

"Precognition?"

"Right."

"How many other people know?"

Commons is entirely empty and they both know it; Dain and Aaric have already checked, but Aaric looks around anyway and his brows knit together when he settles his attention back onto Dain.

"There's quite a few moving parts here," he begins, "but right now, you, Vi, and Sloane."

Dain lifts a brow. 

"Mairi?"

"Yeah, she's smart. And my best friend."

He snorts.

Aaric was near completing his first year as a rider and had somehow cultivated a friendship, in that little bit of time, strong enough that he trusted Sloane with information that could have him killed within seconds. Then there was himself and Violet.

Draithus had changed everything. The battle itself was a blur of wyvern and venin and desperate survival, both internally and externally.

Violet, pulled him aside the day after Draithus to tell him that Xaden had been turned since the battle at Basgiath. He immediately began pressing her, when *exactly* had he turned, under what circumstances, and where only to discover that even Ridoc knew amongst a handful of others, enough to see that he still couldn't be trusted even after he killed Varrish and split the quadrant in two. Even after he stole her father's research for her from his father's quarters, disowned or not. After he risked his life, and Cath's, flying across the ocean for her into unforeseen eventualities that none of them could've been less prepared for.

With her venin lover.

*Best friends.* Right?

"So tell me again?" Dain sighs, "What do you need me to do?"

"Stay in the good graces of the Aretian Generals. And close to Brennan," Aaric pauses, "and your dragon... trust him."

"He's the only one I've ever been able to trust, but thank you for the insight."

Aaric scoffs, "You know that's not how I mean it."

"Then how do you mean it?"

"I mean it in the sense that Cath pulls a lot of weight and influence within the ranks of dragonkind. I didn't—"

He stops, looks around again.

"The premonitions I've had of Cath are... distorted, almost like I'm not supposed to see them. He's the only time my signet experiences disturbances in how it typically works. Him and *you.*"

Dain cracks his fingers, working his index of the knuckle of each one, pressing until the bones bend stiffly.

Cath wasn't normal, this was obvious. Not in the ways dragons had been as studied by humans; his dragon had an oddly stoic, nonchalant disposition. He wasn't keen on being unnecessarily aggressive and, in observation of other riders, he seemed particularly inclined to make Dain's life easier.

"What about Violet?"

Aaric's eyes flare, "Pick a post within Tyrrendor, she needs as many people that she can trust as possible."

"Considering Riorson could've killed us all at any point in time the last few weeks I doubt there's much trust to be had between the two of us."

He remembers that moment just after Tavis had gained consciousness in Hedontis when Riorson looked about ready to remove Ridoc's head and mount it to the wall right where his step-father would be placed next. He'd nearly felt every single intent in the shadow-wielder's body, watched it slip away as Violet anchored him back, repaired his moral compass and reminded him to maintain his humanity.

He should've known then that their whole adventure had two objectives; save Riorson, first, and find Andarna's kind, secondly. But he'd been too focused on the surface mission to see what was really at play beneath, not that either was any less important in the grand scheme of things.

"Don't be like that Dain, I'm sure she had her reasons."

Dain exhales deeply through his nose, peeved at how easily Aaric writes off the offense. The pattern is clear now; trust was conditional, information was selective, and he's always the last to know.

"Oh." Dain leans forward against their table. "That's the problem, isn't it? Everyone had their reasons, everyone knew things I didn't. Did you also know we were traveling with venin in the isles?"

"No."

Dain's eyes narrow.

"Look, I get what you're asking: what did I know, when did I know it. But even if I had known about him turning, what difference does that make now?" Aaric's voice softens, "The man saved the lives of everyone he could in his final moments as himself. Imagine, while being something unhuman, he managed to still maintain more humanity than my father or brother have ever managed as humans."

"I have zero interest," Dain scowls, irritation budding beneath his skin, "in belittling the man who saved Vi, my dragon's life, and mine, to include countless others. His character isn't the point I'm trying to make here."

Aaric stiffens in his seat, "What is it then?"

"The point is that I'm always the last to know. Violet knew about Riorson, probably many others she hadn't mentioned, and I was kept in the dark, *like usual.* You're asking me to trust you both, but how can I when I'm consistently left out of information that directly affects me?"

"Look, it's been weird for the two of you, but I feel like with how stuck under your father you were, and Riorson's position, the constant suspicion was warranted—"

Dain dismisses him with a wave, "Yeah, that's rich. I've considered it all already and I'm not sure Aaric, it seems like my persepctives are always the ones skewered and wrong."

Aaric exhales, clearly recognizing the dismissal, but pushing forward anyway, "Take a Tyrrish outpost if I can't get my father to pass this—"

"Were you the one who sent Mairi past the boundary?"

Aaric freezes.

"She had to."

"She could've died, Cam. Anything could've gone wrong."

Dain does his best not to sound overly invested, though he's sure Aaric will think he's just being a nitpicky dickhead. He'd said he wouldn't coddle first years anymore but he'd spent far more time these last few months watching Sloane Mairi than planned. The impartialness was turning into infatuation, and he wasn't sure Liam would appreciate it. Still, he swore to himself Sloane would survive Basgiath if it was the last thing he did.

He screams internally: he’d committed himself to two women who barely tolerated him.

"I understand that, Dain, I do. But it had to be done."

"I get it. I'm sorry," Dain groans through grit teeth. "I'll cover up for you as much as I can."

He wants to demand answers, to press Aaric about the decision to send Sloane past the boundary, but he understands the limits. Aaric's signet isn't something he discusses freely, and he'd come to Dain of his own volition, trusting him with information that could get him killed. He doesn't want to become another source of stress, not when Aaric's already shaken from revealing himself and actively avoiding his father. He'd only press just enough that Aaric knows he thinks it was stupid, but he won't push beyond that.

Had he been the person he *thought* he was before splitting the quadrant, he's sure Aaric wouldn't have even spared Dain a chance at any of this information, be it morsels or nothing at all.

*You have always been a good person.* Cath snarls; his aggravation is raw and burning in their bond, and Dain tries his best to placate the daggertail,

*That's debatable.*

Cath hisses, growling so menacingly Dain winces when the sound practically shakes his brain from the inside out, *"No, Hatchling, it is not."*

Aaric offers a weak grimace, "Thanks for working with me, and for protecting Sloane in Draithus." more quietly he adds:

"I wasn't sure what would happen to her. I could only see the outcome of the roles bigger than the one she played in, and I know it was unfair to her for me to put that on her."

"Don't thank me for that." Dain hisses. 

He grabs the cup of coffee Aaric had brought him and downs it before changing the subject, "What are the odds, you think, that my father tries to sabotage my Wing during War Games?"

Aaric gives him one of those *let's-be-serious* looks.

"Probably highly, especially considering he operates with the brain capacity of Halden at his age."

Dain drops his head back to glare at the ceiling.

Wonderful.

He wants to push again, to ask questions about information Violet had unwillingly imparted to him; to inquire about the dead elders, the missing eggs, the missing riders. Surely he could've had a vision or premonition, or dream in whatever way the mechanics of his signet worked. Upon assessment, Aaric seems shaken already and had held his breath through revealing himself to Dain. He understands that what Aaric needs is implicit, unfiltered trust that no one had ever willingly given Dain, so he concludes their meeting in favor of his friend's nerves and makes for the courtyard to formation with him in a silent trek.

Once they reach the rotunda, Aaric breaks off for his own posse after sliding his fingers against Dain's in a decade-old show of reassurance. Dain stiffly nods and trudges ahead of the Wing, eyeing his executive officer who seems as indifferent as ever. They don't speak at first, until Maiselle breaks the silence,

"You look a bit better today," she admits with a raised brow.

"And you're... me today." he states stupidly.

Maiselle's signet was one of tricks and foolery; her appearance changed into that of another's at will and she was *constantly* training it.

The surfacing morning light catches on the stone masonry behind them, casting long shadows across the grass where cadets still mill about in loose formation. Dain's taller than he realized, nearly towering over most of the first and second years, his shoulders broader, his frame more imposing than the cadets standing in ranks around them. The brown of his eyes, he notices, is lighter than he'd thought, with amber pooling behind the irises like honey caught in glass. His beard and curls are the same lightly coloured brunette shade, sun-bleached at the edges from hours spent flying over the ocean with no protection from the sun, and he looks exhausted. 

Deep shadows carve themselves beneath his eyes, and there's a tension in his jaw and shoulders that speaks to weeks of sleepless nights and constant vigilance. Overworked. Strained. The weight of leadership and guilt and responsibility settles into every line of his face.

He can't believe he'd ever wanted this position willingly, especially when he'd like nothing more than to mount Cath and fly into the sunset to some faraway location that would leave them safe and equally uncaring.

Dain looks away, uncomfortable with the observation, and focuses on the squad before him.

Silence slithers between the two of them; it's always like this lately, condensed, quiet, and careful. He receives her report, *all conditions normal, all cadets accounted for,* checks it himself, then takes it to Kaori who glances at him, then back at Maiselle *as* him,

"I'll never get used to that," their professor mumbles with a dark chuckle; Dain only offers a disinterested smile before retreating. When he returns back to where he'd stood, he has Maiselle dismiss the Wing but requests Iron Squad stay behind—and they do so, albeit reluctantly.

"Reporting, Wingleader, Sir!" Ridoc chimes, bouncing on the balls of his feet, his soft hair damp from an early shower. It's already pretty warm this early in the morning, and the sun now peeks out from behind the college, filling the darkened sky with pastel coloring.

"Are we reciting the Codex to a cadence?" Cat asks him with venomous sarcasm as she huddles in with the others, obviously annoyed.

"There's not really a nice way for me to break this news," Dain pauses, then lays it out as straight as he can. "I think it would be strange if my dad doesn't try to get rid of me during War Games this year. Knowing him you also shouldn't be surprised if and when it includes anyone else in the process."

There's a deafening silence, and his eyes flicker over to Aaric's, who just nods.

"So just be prepared for that," he amends.

No one seems surprised.

"He wouldn't kill his only son." Matthias begins. 

Dain sneers and presents her a profound glance of doubt.

He clears his throat, "What son?"

Matthias looks away.

"Yeah, I guess that checks out. Completely forgot about your dickhead dad," Ridoc mutters. He bites at his thumbnail and shrugs. "But, it could be worse."

Dain gives him an incredulous look, "Could it be?"

*"Is it that simple?"* he prods at Cath, *"They're just accepting it?"*

*"Maybe they had accepted your consequential existence had been tied to their fate long ago."*

His bond answers with vaguely placed interest, then absconds back to the corners of Dain's mind.

"I mean, imagine if you had pissed off Riorson during Quest Squad. There wouldn't even be a chance to consider it." He takes his thumb out of his mouth and runs it along his throat as if it were a knife.

"Just death by Shadow Daddy."

Dain shudders. Had Ridoc not realized just how close he'd been to death just feet away from plates filled with chocolate death cake? If Riorson's eyes had been any more void of empathy he could've absorbed Ridoc's soul in that very instant.

"Ew, can we please not call him that?" Sloane gags.

"King Tecarus decreed any unnecessary flier deaths would be concerning for Navarre." Sawyer adds, shifting his weight onto Matthias for a moment long enough to stand up straighter, "Everyone's already on edge since anyone could be venin when it's convenient for them now, especially us since... you know."

Right. *Riorson.*

"We'll be fine, Dain," Aaric adds, then squares his shoulders, "Just a hunch."

Dain's eyes rip to Aaric's; *praise Zihnal,* that hunch'd better be the best one he'd ever have.

"Yeah," Imogen only yawns at the news, "We've been through worse at this point, and he's always had it out for us."

She points at her rebellion relic and then to Sloane's.

Imogen looks worse for wear, or at least more than Dain had ever seen her in the three years he'd known her. Quin's death had taken an unbelievable toll on her, then Garick and Bohdi's deaths, compounded by the news of Riorson, all layered with Violet and whatever plan Xaden had been working on.

Hedeon knows he'd be the last to know about that. If at all.

He tilts his head at Imogen, "How are you?"

"About as good as you." she shrugs, brushing wavy pink bangs away from her eyes.

Dain knows she means himself after Draithus, after watching him blow up on Violet so badly Tairn had snarled and snapped at him in the distance. Imogen had been there to witness it all as part of the _Violet-is-no-longer-allowed-to-be-anywhere-by-herself_ rule that Ridoc offered up to Brennan, who accepted it gleefully.

In hindsight, he thinks awkwardly, he should've just said "all right" and walked off, because honestly, what the fuck was he even supposed to do at that point. Everything had already happened. Yelling at her had only been impulsive.

Dain exhales sharply. "We just have to get through War Games."

Then he's done with Basgiath, he could go be some unimportant Lieutenant at an outpost legions away from Basgiath. 

"Hopefully we all make it," Imogen responds meekly.

He nods, then bites at his lip, ripping away chapped skin.

"We'd probably be just as miserable, dead either way."

"You know what," she drawls, rubbing her eyes, "You're right."

---

He spends the rest of the day observing Sloane, who apparently does the same to him during evening formation.

"Aetos."

His attention pivots downwards when she finally approaches him.

"Are you even alive in there?" she bites with apparent exhaustion.

He takes her in without meaning to; her golden hair is braided back from her face in thick, twin plaits, loose strands catching the morning light and framing the sharp angles of her jaw in. Her eyes are that particular shade of icy blue that seems to shift with her mood, currently narrowed in what he assumes is irritation but could just as easily be aggravation from having to muster for formation. 

She's smaller than he remembers but still significantly taller than Violet, or maybe he's just grown taller over the past few months, because the top of her head barely reaches his shoulder even when she's standing so straight. The way she holds herself though, shoulders back and chin lifted, makes her seem larger than she is; there's a confidence in her posture that defies her size and rank. Her uniform fits her properly now, unlike when she'd first arrived at Basgiath swimming in fabric that was clearly meant for someone else, and he notices the way the fabric pulls taut across her chest and how her boots are still polished though scuffed.

"I don't know," he admits, he can feel his face screwing up. "Probably."

He'd been watching Cath fly in circles with Sliseag and Thoirt overhead before she came and distracted him.

"Since when do you *'not know'* things? You should figure your shit out because I'm pretty sure knowing things is part of your rank and personality."

Around them, a few eyes glance their way and he wishes she'd watch her mouth around other Cadets, alas the last part of her statement rings true and he can only think *at least someone gets it.*

"I know nothing now more than ever honestly." Dain suggests before he starts a slow pace toward Commonsl he tries thinking more about coffee and less of her snide ass remark.

"Guess there's a chance I might know something you don't then, finally." she coos, playing with the ends of her braided hair. The sun washes her down in platinum rays and he nearly trips when her skin practically absorbs it all; she looks gilded.

He glances down at her again, "What? You finally decided to train your signet?"

"No," she spits, balling up her fists and running ahead enough that she can turn around and walk backward in front of him. 

"I know you and Aaric have been creeping around. And that you're a literal breathing slimeball, so it can't be good for him."

"Does he know you've been creeping around?" Dain shrugs again. *Gods,* she was the most wretched little thing at times. "And, in my room, at that? Also stop walking like that, it's dangerous."

She turns a subtle shade of pink, and Dain smiles.

"Stop grinning, you shithead." She turns back and resumes walking next to him, "Wanna clue me in on what's going on so I don't have to find out on my own terms?"

"Not really."

"Seriously?" She stops walking entirely and is still staring at him even after he's dozens of feet away. 

When Dain finally stops to turn back to see if she had walked off, she closes the distance between them again,

"Stop treating me like a fucking child," she points an accusatory finger in his face and it tickles his beard.

*Ah,* so she's noticed.

Putting his hands up by his head, Dain sighs. "I promise you, I'm not."

He isn't. While technically you could call what he had been doing favorable treatment, Dain preferred to see it as curated training.

Dain had been pairing her with stronger sparring partners so she'd learn to adapt faster, positioning her in formations that offered better cover during drills, running her through extra combat scenarios after hours when he could justify it as leadership oversight. All of it under the pretense of making sure she was as prepared as possible since she refused to train her signet, since she'd need every advantage she could get without it.

He'd told himself he wasn't coddling her, that he was just ensuring she had the skills to survive, but the truth was he'd been watching her closer than any of her other seniors, adjusting her training in ways that would give her an edge without making it obvious. He'd thought he was being subtle about it, that she wouldn't pick up on the pattern of how he always seemed to be nearby during her training sessions, how he'd redirect other cadets away from her during particularly dangerous drills, using obscure but accurate reasonings to review her technique one-on-one when he could've just as easily let her figure it out on her own.

Her eyes are such a fiery blue right now that they're nearly white as she stands there, yelling at him and getting herself worked up all on her own.

Dain chuckles.

"I'm not treating you like a child but it would behoove you to acknowledge boundaries unlike one." He turns away from her and walks toward Commons to get to the dining hall.

---

Unfortunately, he misses most of the rest of her day for more leadership bullshit and sees his father—even *more* unfortunately. But, almost unironically, Sloane shows up in the thralls of the night, wearing a sleeping set he hadn't seen her in before.

This was their new normal.

Sloane, after Draithus, had been in a particularly exposed state, emotionally and mentally. They'd returned to Basgiath a week after the battle against venin had happened and she'd turned up at the oddest hour of the night, just like this, their first night back at the college.

It had happened about six times in total now, this being the seventh. She never said why she came. Just sat, silent, present, becoming more brazen each time. Watched as he studied, or graded reports, or polished his swords and sharpened his daggers. After her second visit, he started getting in the bed alongside her; sleeping on the floor was uncomfortable, and the bed was plenty big enough for both of them.

However, instead of cursing him out or even scooting against the wall, Sloane had started pressing her back against him. It didn't matter what position he slept in; she was there, flush against his body, and it was fucking intoxicating.

It was innocent, for her, and even for him, until the night he finally couldn't fight an erection and she had backed up against him, against *it.* The presumption was there, and the tension was palpable, practically laced between breaths, lingering like static under the covers, and he'd decidedly just laid awake until formation the next morning in horror.

At first, all he felt was the impending doom for her being there as his cadet but leadership be damned, secondly for never asking why, and for always letting her in. Eventually even sight of her and the smell of her was triggering for him. She came when she needed to, but he waited every night anyway.

*Hoping?* 

Since the day Thoirt and herself blinked past he and Cath in Draithus, they'd been flying around the same speed through his thoughts. Dain spent hours out of his days wondering what she was doing, why she was doing it; if maybe in any way she was trying to tell him something. Maybe, in anyway, if she was thinking about him the same.

And if she was, was it acceptable?

He hadn't said anything, especially the first time it happened, but now she seemed like she was enjoying whatever this was a bit too much. War Games was the excuse he'd been looking for to suggest she stop because he was too—

*"Because being her superior isn't reason enough,"* Cath points out sardonically, beating at him with unimpressed amusement through their bond.

He doesn't respond—*definitely* doesn't admit he's severely touch-starved and fell asleep faster and deeper than he ever had in his life with her scooted up against him in her sleep. 

But if he lets this continue it'd become some sort of sick dependency.

"Where the fuck are your pants, Mairi?" he grits out after opening his door.

*Quickly, tell her to leave then.* Cath commands, gnawing aggression beating down the shields he'd begun to place.

Dain pokes his head into the hallway and peers left then right; it's not too late for most of the other third years to be where they're supposed to be. He grabs her forearm and drags her into his room. He hasn't even bathed yet and she's there.

"Were you about to leave?" she asks absentmindedly because it's late and he's still in his uniform.

He catches her scent first as the opening door pulls it into his room; that clean, 
fresh smell of soap and some unnamed fragrance that was uniquely hers. He's 
memorized it from the nights she's spent in his bed, *dreamed* about it on occasion the days she wasn't there—touched himself while shoving his face into the spot where she had slept soundly the night before. The thought he'd been forming about why she was here, what he should say, fragments and dissolves. His attention narrows to her lips, still damp from her shower and to the water beading in the hollow of her throat and tracing the line of her collarbone. The rest of the hallway, the other doors, the cadets who might be passing by, all of it recedes until there's only her, standing in his doorway, and the way the dampness from her hair catches the light against her skin.

"What?" he gestures at her wickedly, *"Pants?"*

"Huh? No, these are shorts."

Her nightshirt is so big that it blankets the shorts she allegedly wears and leaves the golden expanse of her shoulders exposed and thighs... almost completely. When she lifts it up to show that there are in fact bottoms on her, he spins around and barely catches it,

"Please close the fucking door before flashing me."

She doesn't, so he slams it shut with lesser magic instead.

"Bet you wish I would, wouldn't you."

He doesn’t answer. Not aloud, anyway.

But yes, he _would_ like that.

Cath explodes into a fit of dragconic laughter.

She pads past him to his bed, makes herself comfortable, then glares at him as if _he's_ in the wrong for being in his room.

"Try wearing some actual pants next time you decide to prance through the dormitory." He barks as he collects his things to shower.

"Gods, please relax Wingleader, you're freaking me out. You normally close the door after I walk in," she states as her eyes shrink into slivers of suspicion, and tucks her wet hair behind her ears.

Dain freezes—_normally?_

_"Glad I could be your comedic relief,"_ he exclaims at Cath, then slams his shields up, grabs his towel and storms out to the bathing chamber.

His shower is quick, hot, at first, then so miserably cold he's shivering while drying off.

When he returns she's still there, poking through his notes at his desk, but she's striding towards his armoire when she hears the door click open.

He moves around her without thinking, sidestepping her as she shifts to examine a stack of papers tucked away neatly in his wardrobe, reaching over her shoulder to rifle through his armoire. Sloane doesn't flinch, she doesn't move out of his way; she just continues what she's doing as if his presence is expected. The realization dawns on him then that they've developed a rhythm, an awareness of each other's space that shouldn't exist between a Wingleader and his cadet. He knows exactly where she is without looking, can sense her movements in his periphery, and she does the same.

She's drying her hair with one of his towels, blonde strands falling in thick waves that cascade past her shoulders and catch the dim ambience from mage lights. When she bends forward to flip her hair over, the oversized nightshirt pulls taut across her back, revealing the lean rivets of her spine through the thin fabric, the way her waist narrows and flare into the curve of her hip. She straightens, running her fingers through the damp strands, and the movement shifts the fabric again; he catches glimpses of her silhouette, the slim lines of her figure, the way her body moves with agile grace that tells the tale of months of daily training and natural athleticism.

*You're staring.* Cath's voice leaks into his thoughts, heavy with curiousity.

Dain forces his attention away, focusing on his armoire and grabbing his sleeping set from it, but he's hyperaware of every shift of clothing, every movement she makes behind him. The tension in the room is thick enough to taste, and he knows she feels it too when he catches her peeking at him all the same.
 
She glances at him, realizes he only has a towel wrapped around his waist, then scurries back to the bed, but he catches stolen glances as he pilfers through his armoire.

He calmly puts on his underwear and something soft to sleep in; she surprisingly doesn't say anything about him unabashedly dropping his towel right there in front of her to change, she makes no attempt to avoid watching him while he does so either.

Once he's hugged in thick cotton, dark black and cushy, he picks up the towel and slides it across his damp hair and then reaches in his nightstand for his cologne.

"This," he begins, only a foot or two from her in his bed, "has to stop. We can't do this anymore."

He watches as her eyes widen into aquatic saucers and the color drains from her face entirely.



"Can't do what anymore?"

He whips his head back to see Aaric there, brows raised quizzically.

_Shit._

"We aren't fucking," Sloane says to him slowly.

Dain's brows draw together: _why should Aaric care that they are or aren't?_

"What? I don't care—_ew,_" Aaric says to her.

Dain grabs Aaric's forearm and pulls him into the room, slamming the door after him. He sits at Dain's desk, settling in like he usually does. The owner of the room is then left with only the bed next to Sloane or the table to the right of the desk.

He groans knowing he's just barely managed to fight off the pending erections and picks the table.

"So... _Wingleader._ And Cadet—" his room becomes uncomfortably quiet when Aaric starts up,

Dain opens his mouth, looks up at the cobblestone ceiling and groans. "Aaric, please, don't."

"I just wanted to stop by and update you on something you might need to know," he sings, completely ignoring Sloane still, "But it looks like I need an update from you too..."

Dain buries his face in his hands. Gods help him.

"Don't be fucking nasty, Aaric." Sloane spits.

He gives her a look that would slide underneath even Riorson's skin, "Nasty is the only way you like it Sloane."

Dain finds himself parsing what Aaric purrs in response to Sloane, trying to understand what he actually means. Is he referring to something that happens between them, something intimate that Dain shouldn't know about? Or is it just Aaric acknowledging that Sloane doesn't give a shit about propriety, that she'll say whatever she wants without caring who hears it, the same way Mira never bothered to filter herself around anyone? The ambiguity makes his chest tighten, and he realizes he doesn't want to know which one it is.

He tucks his childish jealousy away where he won't be bothered by it.

Aaric hands Dain a parchment scroll and turns to Sloane.

"What is it?" she asks Aaric suspiciously as Dain unfurls it.


	*'As of 635 AU. King Tauri imposes that all graduating riders of the Aretian Riot will begin active duty service with the Aretian Independent Arms.'*

"What is it?" Sloane whispers again, rising from the bed to peek at the parchment.

"Where are your pants?" Aaric taunts her, crossing his arms, "That's not very _'we aren't fucking'_ of you."

"Why isn't this on an announcement board?" Dain puzzles aloud,

"Probably just a need-to-know thing. Besides, I'm sure the rest of the Aretian Riot won't be surprised to find themselves stationed there after we graduate." He shrugs.

"I have on shorts." She picks up her nightshirt again, and Aaric's reaction is identical to Dain's.

"*Brother*, please keep your clothes on." He coughs, now facing Dain entirely.

"So I can go there for sure—not just an outpost." Dain gasps aloud, but mostly he wonders; he wouldn't call the woman he lies with his 'brother,' so why does Aaric? Dain grmimaces—is he misunderstanding something? 

Sloane only flicks him off.

Aaric grins. "_Permanently,_ once I'm done convincing this greedy old fuck. Also, I won't be in Aretia with you this rotation. Good luck."

He gets up and exits as quickly and unannounced as he entered after addressing Sloane, "We can discuss this," he points at Dain, "later."

Sloane watches Dain from the foot of his bed.

"Things are happening again, aren't they? But instead of it being Xaden and Violet, and virtually every other marked one besides me, it's you—you and Aaric." her voice is oddly soft for such a loaded accusation.

Dain feels the sharp pang of empathy; he understands her frustration.

"Yes."

Her eyes bulge, and he battles the urge to walk across the room and maybe hug her, though he's sure he successfully avoids being stabbed to death by her in the process.

"Tell me."

"I can't." Dain sighs,

Her brows knit, cutely, "You won't or you can't?"

Sloane only hears the truth in his silence.

"You'll let me sleep in your bed with you but you won't offer me pertinent information," her voice breaks mid-sentence. "I guess we're both just two unsurely outcasts, aren't we?"

His resolve falters at her tone, her dejected stance overwhelming him while she sits cozied into his bed,

"Look, it's not my place to share any of what's going on with him."

"Or mine," she snaps. "Since he's _my_ best friend, but he's here consulting with _you._"

Dain's eye twitches.

Is Aaric the reason she had been hovering?

Dain and Aaric had unspoken history between the two of them that he's sure would never leave the confines of their memories.

"You also can't come in here like this anymore," he circumvents, softly, gently consolidating the command with his previous statement. "As leadership it's inappropriate, and..."

And he's starting to *assume.*

All Dain can think of suddenly are the faces Violet made each time he tried, and failed, at doing what he thought was right for her. What he thought _she_ wanted from him—

But Sloane doesn’t argue. Just leaves—quiet, and unreadable.

He sinks into his bed after a few moments, and it's still warm where she’d been and his sheets are poisoned with her lulling scent.

Eventually hours pass but sleep doesn’t come, he can _feel_ Cath about to slander him when the Red finally stirs, but Dain beats the him to it:

_"Don't."_

_"You could use the advice,"_ Cath mutters.

Dain huffs a breath, half-laugh, half-exhale. Romantic advice from his emotional support apex predator. He doesn’t bother trying to sleep again. The bed feels wrong now, too big, and too empty, and too warm on one side.

Instead, he lies there and thinks about Sloane, and about the way she always shows up without asking. About how he never tells her not to.

_"Ask her why,"_ Cath suggests, deadpan and aggressive, _"At this point we are both plagued with thoughts of her."_

Dain groans and buries his face in the pillow. _"You could just... not?"_

Indignation crackles through the wasteland their bond embodies like ice. _"As you could also just not."_
