### [Chapter 1](https://archiveofourown.org/works/63478354/chapters/162656737): Dain

"Precognition?"

"Right."

"How many other people know?"

Commons is entirely empty—and they both know it, since he and Aaric have already checked—but Aaric looks around anyway, and his brows knit together when he settles his attention back onto Dain.

"There's... a few moving parts here," he begins, "but right now, you, Vi, and Sloane."

Dain lifts a brow. "Mairi?"

"Yeah, she's smart. And my best friend."

He snorts.

Aaric was near completing his first year as a rider and had somehow cultivated a friendship, in that little bit of time, strong enough that he trusted Sloane with information that could have him killed within seconds. Then there was himself and Violet.

Violet, who pulled him aside the day after Draithus to tell him that Xaden had been turned since the battle at Basgiath—which even _Ridoc_ knew amongst a handful of others—that he couldn't be trusted even after he killed Varrish and split the quadrant in two. Even though he stole research for her from his father's quarters, disowned or not. After he risked his life—and Cath's—flying across the ocean for her into unforeseen eventualities that none of them could've been less prepared for.

_Best friend._

"So tell me again?" Dain sighs. "What do you need me to do?"

"Stay in the good graces of the Aretian Generals. And close to Brennan," he pauses, "and your dragon... trust him."

"He's the only one I've ever been able to trust," Dain sighs. "But thank you for the insight."

Aaric raises a brow. "You know that's not how I mean it."

"Then how do you?"

"I mean it in the sense that Cath pulls a lot of weight and influence within the ranks of dragonkind. I didn't..."

He stops, looks around again.

"The _visions_ I've had of Cath are... distorted, almost like I'm not supposed to see them. He's the only time my signet experiences disturbances in how it typically works."

Dain cracks his fingers.

Cath wasn't normal—not in the ways dragons had been as studied by humans. His dragon had an oddly stoic, nonchalant disposition. He wasn't keen on being unnecessarily aggressive and, in observation of other riders, he seemed particularly inclined to make Dain's life easier.

"What about Violet?"

Aaric's eyes flare. "You need to stay in Tyrrendor, stay close no matter what—I know you probably feel wronged with all that's happened—"

"Oh." Dain leans forward against their table. "Did you _also_ know we were traveling with venin in the isles?"

"No."

Dain's eyes narrow.

"Even if I had, what difference does that make now? Didn't he save the lives of everyone that he could in his final moments as himself? Imagine—while being something unhuman, he managed to still maintain more humanity than my father or brother have ever displayed _as humans._"

"I have zero interest," Dain scowls, "in belittling the man who saved Vi, _my dragon's life_, and mine, to include countless others. His _character_ isn't the point I'm trying to make here."

Aaric leans back in his seat.

"What is it then?"

"You’re asking _me_ to trust you both," Dain says slowly. "But Violet still acts like I’m the last person she’d confide in."

"Look, it's been weird for the two of you, but I feel like with how stuck under your father you were, and her relationship with Riorson, it was warranted—"

Dain dismisses him with a wave. "Yeah, that's rich. I've heard it already though."

"Take a Tyrrish outpost if I can't get my father to pass this—"

"Were you the one who sent Mairi past the boundary?"

He freezes.

"She had to."

"She could've died, Cam. Anything could've gone wrong."

He does his best not to sound overly invested, though he's sure Aaric will think he's just being a nitpicky dickhead—he'd said he wouldn't coddle first years anymore, except for the very exception to that rule. He’d protect Vi, absolutely, but he spent far more time these last few months watching and investing time into Sloane Mairi. He's not sure Liam would appreciate his impartialness, probably turning infatuation at that, on account that he had gotten him killed—but he swore to himself Sloane would survive Basgiath if it was the last thing he did.

He scoffs inwardly; he’d committed himself to two women who barely tolerated him.

"I understand that, Dain, I do. But it had to be done."

"I get it. I'm sorry," Dain groans through grit teeth. "I'll cover up for you as much as I can with your signet."

Aaric offers a weak grimace. "Thanks... for working with me, and for protecting Sloane."

"Don't thank me for that." Dain hisses. He grabs the cup of coffee Aaric had brought him and downs it. "What are the odds, you think, that my father tries to sabotage my Wing during War Games?"

Aaric gives him one of those _let's-be-serious_ looks.

"Probably highly, especially considering he operates with the brain capacity of Halden at his age."

Dain drops his head back to look at the ceiling.

Wonderful.

He wants to push—to ask the necessary questions; to inquire about the dead elders, the missing eggs, the missing _riders._ But, upon assessment, Aaric seems shaken already and had held his breath through revealing himself to Dain. He understands that what Aaric needs is implicit, unfiltered trust that no one had ever willingly given Dain, so he concludes their meeting in favor of his friend's nerves and makes for the courtyard to formation with him in a silent trek.

Once they reach the rotunda, Aaric breaks off for his own posse after sliding his fingers against Dain's in a decade-old show of reassurance. Dain stiffly nods and trudges ahead of the Wing, eyeing his executive officer who seems as indifferent as ever. They don't speak at first, until Maiselle breaks the silence,

"You look a bit better today," she admits with a raised brow.

"And you're... me today."

Her signet was changing her appearance into that of another's and she was _constantly_ training it. Silence slithers between the two of them—it's always like this lately: condensed, quiet, and careful. He receives her report, _all conditions normal,_ checks it himself, then takes it to Kaori who glances at him, then back at Maiselle as him,

"I'll never get used to that," he mumbles with a dark chuckle.

When he returns he has Maiselle dismiss the Wing, but Dain requests Iron Squad stay behind—and they do so, albeit reluctantly.

"Reporting, wingleader, _Sir_!" Ridoc chimes, bouncing on the balls of his feet, his soft hair damp from an early shower. It's already pretty warm this early in the morning, and the sun is peeking out from behind the college, filling the dark sky with pastel coloring.

"Are we reciting the Codex to a cadence?" Cat asks him with venomous sarcasm as she huddles in with the others, obviously annoyed.

"There's not really a nice way for me to break this news."

He pauses, then lays it out as straight as he can. "I think it would be strange if my dad doesn't try to kill you guys—but obviously me—during War Games this year."

There's a deafening silence, and his eyes flicker over to Aaric's, who nods.

"So just be prepared for that," he amends.

"He wouldn't kill his only son," Matthias begins. Dain sneers and presents her a profound glance of doubt.

He clears his throat and suggests, "What son?"

Matthias looks away.

"Yeah, I guess that checks out. Completely forgot about your dickhead dad," Ridoc mutters. He bites his thumbnail and shrugs. "But, it could be worse."

Dain gives him an incredulous look. "Could it be?"

_"Is it that simple?"_ he prods at Cath.

_"Maybe they had accepted your consequential existence had been tied to their fate long ago."_

His bond answers with vaguely placed interest, then absconds back to the corners of his mind.

"I mean, imagine if you had pissed off Riorson during Quest Squad. There wouldn't even be a chance to consider it." He takes his thumb out of his mouth and runs it along his throat.

"Just death by Shadow Daddy."

Dain chokes. _Shadow Daddy?_

"Ew, can we please not call him that?" Sloane gags.

"King Tecarus decreed any unnecessary flier deaths would be concerning for Navarre too," Sawyer adds, shifting his weight onto Matthias for a moment long enough to stand up straighter.

"Everyone just thinks anyone could be venin when it's convenient for them now, especially us since... you know."

Right. _Riorson._

"We'll be fine, Dain," Aaric adds, then squares his shoulders. "Just a hunch."

"Yeah," Imogen yawns, "We've been through worse at this point."

Imogen looks worse for wear—or at least more than Dain had ever seen her in the three years he'd known her. Quin's death had taken an unbelievable toll on her, then naturally Garick and Bohdi, to compound the news of Riorson, all layered on Violet and his plan—whatever that had been.

Hedeon knows he'd be the last to know about that—if at all.

He blinks at her. "How are you?"

"About as good as you."

Dain knows she means himself after Draithus, after watching him blow up on Violet so badly Tairn had snarled _and_ snapped at him. Imogen had been there as part of the _Violet-is-no-longer-allowed-to-be-anywhere-by-herself_ rule that Ridoc offered up to Brennan, who accepted it.

In hindsight, he thinks awkwardly, he should've just said "all right" and walked off, because honestly, what the fuck was he even supposed to do at that point. Everything had already happened.

Dain exhales sharply. "We just have to get through War Games."

"Hopefully we all make it," she responds meekly.

He nods, again, again, then bites at his lip, ripping chapped skin off.

"We'd probably be just as miserable, dead."

"You know what," she drawls, rubbing her eyes, "You're right."

---

He spends the rest of the day observing Sloane, who _apparently_ does the same to him during evening formation.

"Aetos."

His attention pivots downwards when she finally approaches him.

"Are you even alive in there?" she bites with apparent exhaustion.

"I don't know," he admits. He can feel his face screwing up. "Probably."

He'd been watching Cath fly in circles with Sliseag and Thoirt overhead.

"Since when do you *'not know'* things? You should figure your shit out because I'm pretty sure knowing things is part of your rank."

Around them, a few eyes glance their way and he wishes she'd watch her mouth around other Cadets.

"Actually, since the end of my second year—and now more than ever." He starts a slow pace toward Commons, thinking more about coffee and ignoring her snide ass remark.

"Guess there's a chance I might know something you don't then, fucking finally," she coos, playing with the end of her braided hair. The sun clears the top of Basgiath and washes her down in platinum rays.

He glances down at her again. "You finally decided to train your signet?"

"No," she spits, balling up her fists and running ahead enough that she can turn around and walk backward in front of him. "I know you and Aaric have been creeping around. And you're a literal breathing slimeball, so it can't be good for him."

"Does he know you've been creeping around?" Dain shrugs again. _Gods,_ she was the most wretched little thing at times. "_In my room_, at that? And stop walking like that, it's dangerous."

She turns pink, and Dain smiles.

"Stop grinning, you shithead." She turns back and resumes walking next to him. "Wanna clue me in on what's going on?"

"Not really."

"Seriously?"

She stops walking entirely and is still staring at him even after he's dozens of feet away. When he finally stops to turn back to see if she had walked off, she closes the distance between them.

"Stop treating me like a fucking child," she points an accusatory finger in his face and it tickles his beard. "I don't need protecting."

_Ah,_ so she'd noticed.

Putting his hands up by his head, Dain sighs. "I promise you, I'm not."

Her eyes are such an icy blue right now that they're nearly white as she stands there, yelling at him and getting herself worked up all on her own. Dain chuckles.

"And you actually don't need protecting; you need to acknowledge boundaries." He turns away from her and walks toward Commons to get to the dining hall.

---

Unfortunately, he misses most of the rest of the day for more leadership bullshit and sees his father—even _more_ unfortunately. But, almost unironically, she shows up in the thralls of the night, wearing a sleeping set he hadn't seen her in before.

This was their new normal.

Sloane, after Draithus, had been in a particularly exposed state, emotionally and mentally. They'd returned to Basgiath the day after everything happened and she'd turned up at the oddest hour of the night, just like this.

It had happened about six times in total now, this being the seventh. She never said why she came. Just sat, silent, present—closer each time. Watched as he studied, or graded reports, or polished his boots and sharpened his blades. After her second visit, he started getting in the bed alongside her; sleeping on the floor was uncomfortable, and the bed was plenty big enough for both of them.

However, instead of cursing him out or even scooting against the wall, Sloane had started pressing her back against him—it didn't matter what position he slept in; she was there, flush against his body, and it was fucking _intoxicating._

It was innocent, for her, and even for him, until he finally couldn't fight an erection and she backed against him _harder._ The presumption was there, and the tension was palpable—laced between breaths, lingering like static under the covers—and he'd just laid awake until formation the next morning.

At first, all he felt was guilt for her being there, for never asking why, for always letting her in, but then the sight of her and even the smell of her was triggering for him. She came when she needed to, but he waited every night anyway.

Since the day Thoirt and herself blinked past he and Cath in Draithus, they'd been flying around the same speed through his thoughts. Dain spent hours out of his days wondering what she was doing, why she was doing it; if maybe in any way she was trying to tell him something.

He hadn't said anything, especially the first time it happened, but now she seemed like she was enjoying whatever this was a bit too much, and now, War Games was the excuse he'd been looking for to suggest she stop because he was too—

_"Because being her superior isn't reason enough,"_ Cath points out sardonically, beating at him with unimpressed amusement through their bond.

He doesn't respond—_definitely_ doesn't admit he's severely touch-starved and fell asleep faster and deeper than he ever had at Basgiath with her scooted up against him in her sleep.

"Where the fuck are your pants, Mairi?" he grits out after opening his door.

Dain pokes his head into the hallway and peers left then right; it's not too late for most of the other third years to be where they're supposed to be. He grabs her forearm and drags her into his room. He hasn't even bathed yet and she's there.

"Were you about to leave?" she asks absentmindedly.

"What?" he gestures at her wickedly, "Pants?"

"Huh? No, these are shorts."

Her nightshirt is so big that it blankets the shorts she allegedly wears and leaves the golden expanse of her shoulders exposed and thighs almost completely. When she lifts it up to show that there are in fact shorts on her, he spins around and barely catches it,

"Please close the fucking door before flashing me."

She doesn't, so he slams it shut with lesser magic instead.

"Bet you wish I would, wouldn't you."

He doesn’t answer. Not aloud, anyway.

Yes, he _would_ like that.

She pads past him to his bed, makes herself comfortable, then glares at him as if _he's_ in the wrong for being in his room.

_"Funny,"_ Cath chortles across the bond.

"Try wearing some actual pants next time you decide to prance through the dormitory." He barks as he collects his things to shower.

"Gods, please relax wingleader, you're freaking me out. You normally close the door after I walk in," she states, eyes narrowing on him in disgust.

He freezes—_normally_?

_"Glad I could be your comedic relief,"_ he exclaims at Cath, then slams his shields up, grabs his towel and storms out to the bathing chamber.

When he returns she's still there, poking through his notes at his desk.

She glances at him, realizes he only has a towel wrapped around his waist, then scurries back to the bed, but he catches the stolen glances as he pilfers through his armoire.

He calmly puts on his underwear and sleeping wear; she surprisingly doesn't say anything about him unabashedly dropping his towel right there in front of her to change. Dain sighs once he's in his favorite set—dark black and made of heavy, breathable linen. The pants are a bit long and gather at the bottom of his feet so he drags them enough to not trip intentionally.

He picks up the towel and slides it across his damp hair and then reaches in his nightstand for his cologne.

"This," he begins, only a foot or two from her in his bed, "has to stop. We can't do this anymore."

He watches as her eyes widen into aquatic saucers and the color drains from her face entirely.

_Shit._

"Can't do what anymore?"

He whips his head back to see Aaric there, brows raised quizzically.

"We aren't fucking," Sloane says to him slowly.

Dain narrows his eyes. _Why should Aaric care?_

"What? I don't care—_ew_," he says to her.

Dain—lets relief sink into his nerves—grabs Aaric's forearm and pulls him into the room, slamming the door after him. He pads over to Dain's desk and sits in the chair, settling in like he usually does. The owner of the room is left with only the bed next to Sloane or the table to the right of the desk.

He picks the table, and the room becomes uncomfortably quiet when Aaric starts up,

"So... _wingleader_. And Cadet—"

Dain opens his mouth, looks up at the cobblestone ceiling and groans. "Aaric, please, don't."

"I just wanted to stop by and update you on something I've discovered," he says, completely ignoring Sloane. "But it looks like I need an update from you too... even though she says it's not _up_, I guess."

Dain buries his face in his hands. Gods help him.

"Don't be fucking nasty, Aaric." Sloane screeches.

Aaric hands Dain a parchment scroll and turns to Sloane.

"What is it?" she asks him suspiciously.

	_'As of 635 AU. King Tauri imposes that all graduating riders of the Aretian Riot will begin active duty service with the Aretian Independent Arms.'_

"What is it?" Sloane whispers again, rising from the bed to peek at the parchment.

"Where are your pants?" Aaric asks her, crossing his arms. "That's not very _'we aren't fucking'_ of you."

"Why isn't this on an announcement board?" Dain puzzles aloud.

"Probably just a need-to-know thing. Besides, I'm sure the rest of the Aretian Riot won't be surprised to find themselves stationed there after we graduate." He shrugs.

"I have on shorts." She picks up her nightshirt again, and Aaric's reaction is identical to Dain's.

"Brother, please keep your clothes on." He coughs, now facing Dain entirely.

"So I can go there for sure—not just an outpost." Dain gasps.

Aaric grins. "_Permanently_, once I'm done convincing this greedy old fuck. And I won't be in Aretia with you this rotation. Good luck."

He gets up and exits as quickly and unannounced as he entered.

Sloane watches Dain from the foot of his bed.

"Things are happening again, aren't they? But instead of it being Xaden and Violet, and virtually every other marked one besides me, it's you—you and Aaric."

Dain feels the sharp pang of empathy; he understands her frustration.

But now he also understands Violet's position.

"Yes."

Her eyes bulge, and he fights the urge to walk across the room and maybe hug her—he's sure he successfully avoids being stabbed to death by her in the process.

"Tell me."

"I can't."

Her brows knit, cutely. "You won't or you can't?"

She hears the truth in his silence.

"You'll let me sleep in your bed with you but you won't offer me pertinent information," her voice breaks mid-sentence. "I guess we're both just two unsurely outcasts, aren't we?"

His resolve falters at her tone, her stance. "Look, it's not my place to share any of what's going on with him."

"Or mine," she snaps. "Since he's _my_ best friend, but he's here consulting with _you._"

"You also can't come in here like this anymore," he says, softly, gently consolidating the command with his previous statement. "As leadership it's inappropriate, and..."

_And he's starting to assume._

All he can think of are the faces Violet made each time he tried, and failed, at doing what he thought was right for her—what he thought _she_ wanted from him—

—Sloane doesn’t argue. Just leaves—quiet, and unreadable.

He sinks into the bed, still warm where she’d been. The hours pass and sleep doesn’t come. He can _feel_ Cath about to slander him when he finally stirs, but Dain beats the Red to it:

_"Don't."_

_"You could use the advice,"_ Cath mutters.

Dain huffs a breath, half-laugh, half-exhale. _Of course._ Romantic advice from his emotional support apex predator.

He doesn’t bother trying to sleep again. The bed feels wrong now—too big, too empty, and too warm on one side.

Instead, he lies there and thinks about Sloane, and about the way she always shows up without asking. About how he never tells her not to.

_"Ask her why,"_ Cath suggests, deadpan and aggressive. _"At this point we are both plagued with thoughts of her."_

Dain groans and buries his face in the pillow. _"You could just... not?"_

Indignation crackles through the wasteland their bond embodies like ice. _"As could you."_
