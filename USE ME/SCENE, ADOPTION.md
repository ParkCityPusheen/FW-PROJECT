Sloane's been with her fair share of men.

Older, younger, taller, shorter, well spoken, and standoffish. It's always, always hard and fast and then harder and faster. There's times that she manages to get herself off, but it's never at the hands of her partner—maybe just once *or* twice.

She realizes, the fourth time they finally have sex, that no men are written like Dain Aetos.

His climaxes are only prompted by hers, and he's eager to please. He also says that—says *please,* let me cum in you, *please,* say my name, *please,* touch me more. He's effortlessly more vocal than any man she could've imagined, or had been with. 

His orgasms drain all of the life out of him, and he moans her name every time he finishes, always trembling against her. Her name is a cadence out of his mouth, no nickname's during sex, only hers. She bites down on her lip thinking about her favorites, that husky, *"Sloane... ugh, Sloane cum with me...*" or, "*Sloane you feel so good, can you feel me? Do I feel good enough for you?*"; and last night, *"I know just how you like it Sloane, I'm your good boy, I know everything you like."*

Dain's always desperate to get his mouth on her. He licks and laves until she blooms around him... or sometimes on him like spring showers, sucks and nibbles until she begs him to stop. He's left marks on her countless times; that's something he doesn't think about until he finds those perverted traces of himself stained dark red on her throat.

When he's finished with her, the skin around her eyes are tinged pink and her lips pucker into a bratty pout from his assaults. All of these things he drinks in: touching her lips, kissing her eyelids, sniping the hickeys he leaves on her from across the mess and in hallways. In *his* classrooms, during *his* classes.

His hands are always busy on her body. Pressing her into his mattress, grabbing handfuls of her ass, collaring his hand against her throat and gripping her jutting hip bones like reins. He likes to mold her where he wants her, and then he takes her that way, pressing his thick body against her; he always manages to find leverage somehow, and rhythm. 

His tempo and stamina are *immaculate*—he's got to be a great dancer the way he leads and maintains his positions—he lets her adjust and retreats out just until the crown of him pulls at her entrance before lazily, thoroughly replacing his shaft inside of her. 

There's something so fucking masculine about the way he watches himself disappear inside of her with his mouth hanging open or his lips captured against his teeth, the way he cranes his neck back and groans when she squeezes down on him, how he shudders when she nips at his ears as he fucks her on her back; or, simple the deep, "*Mmmmm...*" as he settles into her and his flow.
 
She peaks at him through the crack in his suite's door, where he sits at his desk reading an unfolded missive, chewing at the end of his ink pen.

She can't stop.

She was so stupid for waiting so long to accept him, to *consider* him.

He was her custom-made perfection.

Eight heavy inches, curved to the left and boasting girth that she could only dream her fingers would touch while wrapped around him. A sack full of come that Sloane liked to think she milked out of him while she massaged his balls whenever he bent his knee and took her faster, and rougher from the back. Dain scraped and stretched her so fucking good it made her see flashing lights in the shapes of the veins behind her eyes.

She slid down the wall, jumping like a cat when the hilt of her glaive smashes into the floor behind her.

"Fuck..." she groans, *"Fuck."*

"Shouldn't you be in class?"

She drags her eyes across his legs and up his torso to his face, "Good afternoon, First Lieutenant Aetos."

Dain's hardened glare melts into something soft and reverent.

"Good afternoon, *squad leader* Mairi." he grins at her wickedly, "Come here. I'm *so* proud of you."

She leaps right into him and smashes her face into his pecs, they squeeze against her as his arms press against her sides; binding her into a suffocating, muscular hug, "I saw this potential from legions away, Sloane. Don't stop being better."

"Thank you, so much." she purrs breathlessly, taking in his woodsy scent, "Can we get lunch together? I'll only be missing weapons training," she presses her chin into his chest and peers up at him through her lashes, "And I don't *need* it."

He glances down at her and Sloane watches the bushy ends of his brows press inwards as he thinks, "Sure... just this once, we can get lunch in town."

She can't help but grin—she get's him every fucking time at this angle.

Sloane beams, then pauses, "Wait, we don't have enough time to walk there and back."

"I have a horse." Dain says as he saunters back into the office, buckling the halberds scabbard across his chest, after pulling his uniform top back on, and his flight jacket, "We have plenty."

She stops just ahead of desk, watching, "...Impulse purchase?"

She asks it carefully, not because she's scared to offend him, but because it was delicate topic.

"Nope," he lifts the halberd from its rack on the desk and flips it behind his back; her runes activate and the shaft snaps to the metal plate against his scabbard. He rolls his shoulders, making sure its secure, and tightens its belt across his chest,

"I wanted to talk to you about that too."

"Money?" she guesses, calmly,

"Yes." he pauses at the edge of the desk and meets her eyes with his warm, chestnut ones impishly, 

"I opened an account with an Aretian banks, and General Ferris decided to represent me in court against my father for divesting my inheritance. I wasn't aware, but apparently leaving me financially high-and-dry is considered a crime because it happened while I was in an actively in a deployed status."

Sloane cocks her head, "But you aren't Tyrrish."

You could only open banking accounts in Aretia if you were the child or grandchild of an natively Tyrrish citizen, it required visiting said banks with proof birth and residency.

"Well," Dain clears his throat and taps the sharp downward angle of the lacquered wood, "*legally* I'm now officially a noble by Tyrrish heritage, *and* political influence."

Sloane fiddles with the edge of her uniform, "Wasn't that decided when you were elected as an ambassador?"

"No, it would've taken much more than that."

He pivots a bit; he seems... on edge, but not panicked.

"What gives you status as a Tyrrish citizen?" she mumbles, blinking at his kept face,

"I'm Ulises Ferris's first and only son; he adopted me into his House."

Leaving Riorson House at the side of Tyrrendor's first *official* Squadron flightleader, and Tyrrish Ambassador (recently meritoriously advanced) First Lieutenant Aetos, now the only son of the *High House Ferris*, puts a dangerous bounce in Sloane's steps. She plants a wet, kiss on his lips before they leave his office, and military bearing sinks into both of them as they descend the steps to the Grand Hall.

Sloane remembers the way crowds used to split perfectly down the middle for Xaden, and the way he swaggered through it, cold, and uncaring. The permanent scowl he wore and the stress that may not have been prevalent in his face, but definitely drew his shoulders together in a taught line.

Dain can't get *through* a crowd without being proverbially swamped, smiled at or approached, and he walks with a confident, statuesque pace and a determined face. He dismisses himself from clogging groups quickly, returns those passing interactions with a curt nod, or the slight lift of his chin, and only truly regards those of higher ranking out of protocol. 

He let's Sloane lead him to the stables past the mess hall, makeshift classrooms, and busy offices without overwhelming her lead and it makes it her giddy knowing this capable man falls instep behind her willingly. Passerby's glance at him and then down to her, and she's sure they look right together: lean, determined, and intelligent, with their polearms swinging at their backs clothed in rider black and tandem brown. 

"Did you end up getting a stallion?" she asks him casually, tossing the question over her shoulder as they brush past a group of third-years leaving their rune courses who salute and greet Dain eagerly.

"A mare," he grins, "She's a lot like you."
