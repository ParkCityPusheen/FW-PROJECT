There's a shuffle, the soft presses of broken in, military-grade boots across the lacquered floors of the office and then the unmistakable sweep of the curtain separating the attached bedroom from it.

It takes Dain seconds to register the sound, to place himself in the bed and Sloane there with him plastered against his back. He can feel the cooling, gossamer-soft strands of her hair splayed the length of his spine and tickling his waist and through it, her warmth—the steady *th-thump* of her beating heart.

The duvet rolls down to his waist first, and then the flat sheet. His shirt lifts just above his chest.

Is she up?

He scowls in his sleep; he hadn't felt the sinking of the feather mattress or the tell-tale whine in her yawn signifying her wake.

The deceptive warmth of a signet floods his torso and he understands that it's Brennan doing his routine bed check—he came once in the morning, before breakfast, and once before dinner. Dain winces, waking fully at the pinch of his muscles and the tightening of sinew. Brennan works one wound at a time, gauging his body's reaction to the signet, and then removing the sutures if his body takes to it,

"Brennan," he murmurs with a sleep-burred timbre.

Dain's eyes feel much heavier than they usually do, and his body objects as he moves the fractional amount he manages, but he gets them open and makes out the details of the oldest Sorrengail's face in the dim mage light while magic thrums between them. His emotions there are playing between inquisitive and surprise,

"...A Mairi, huh?" Brennan hums, singing almost, "The *last* Mairi." 

Brennan’s mending him—trying—and Sloane’s dead to the world, curled naked against his back like a sleeping housecat.

He slept with her last night.

Last night was *real*.

"Shit."

"I won't tell anyone." Brennan teases softly, quietly, and casts an understanding onceover down the length of his body, "But I'm not removing any evidence."

"What evidence?" he grumbles,

"I'm sure you'll see it." Brennan sighs, shrugging, "Anyway, still bedrest—,"

Dain rolls his eyes, "Yes two weeks I understand Brennan."

"No—,"

"Fighting, flying,—,"

Brennan lifts his chin, "*Fucking,*"

Dain's eyes narrow, "...you never said that until now."

He groans, "Look, you got yourself launched across a dragon den and reopened every wound on the left side of your abdomen. And, you've now fucked open the ones at your naval."

Brennan lifts the flat sheet to showcase all the bleeding he'd done in his sleep.

Dain's looks away. He knows he's not being a proper patient.

"I'm glad though," he runs his hands over each scar and Dain follows the movement; there's still a few left that refuse to mend, "that you found someone."

Dain let's himself sink into the declaration, "I'm scared."

"Don't be." Brennan says curtly, then places a hand on his shoulder, *"Don't be."*

There's something invaluably kind about his amber eyes that don't mix with the stern frown that pulls his lips tight.

"Keep sleeping on your back," he points at the pillow rolled under Dain's neck, "Keep your neck elevated, and please eat. If it's just a little bit that's fine, but I need you eating. The healers will find you with meds when you need to take them, and I can't trust that lung or whatever's going on with your heart right now so just... take it easy please, Dain."

He pours a full glass of water from the carafe Sloane had brought up earlier, and hands Dain a cocktail of pills with it.

"I will." he yawns, tosses them down his throat and washes the bitterness away with the water.

Brennan straightens his back and his eyes slip over Sloane before pulling the sheets back and placing the glass back on the carafe, then leaving as silently as he entered.

He stares at nothing for a moment, waiting for sleep to reclaim him but the irresistible lull of drowsiness has abandoned him entirely, and he rolls over to watch the rise and fall of Sloane's torso.

*She's right there.*

She’s right here—alive, real, *willing*.

His emotions are bursting and quick, flicking and jerking like guppies in shallow ponds that occupy his heart and mind. 

Hopefully this wouldn't be a one time thing.

It couldn't be.

He was so good for her, a perfect fit, a complimentary augment like dyes on fabrics, metal settings for jewels. They were great separate, but so perfect *together*. Dain thinks, mulls over the things he could say to her to keep him there, in her heart—and if nothing else, in his bed.

Restlessness scratches the soles of his feet and he raises up carefully, creeping over to the edge of the bed to sit and stare into the blackness of the early morning. He eyes the pale, periwinkle edge of the suns approach along the cliffs through the glass terrace doors, at a glance the blurred line was grainy and silver like the mage lights reflecting off the coronas of Sloane's eyes last night.

All he had to do was *talk* to her; he would talk to her, properly profess his feelings. and they could keep getting to know each other over time.

Dain presses into his thighs with his elbows and rubs his face.

Did they have *time?* 

Was that something Amari would grant him?

His pessimism threatens to burn him and he retreats to the office, sliding into the chair to begin annotating the venin tomes Violet had given him.

---

He's been up for a few hours when Sloane shuffles in the bedroom; Dain leans back into his chair and waits for her to emerge.

She's *sublime*.

Barefooted and encased in his flight jacket again; she's only zipped it up enough to half-heartedly cover her breasts—her clavicle and shoulder's are exposed completely—her hands are hidden in the length of the sleeves that sink in at her elbows, and it pools mid-thigh around her legs. Her hair is *everywhere,* perfectly flaxen tresses falling to her waist in a wedding-veil like cast, curving with rough flicks fiercely at the ends. He squeezes his eyes shut and rips them open to make sure casual perfection had truly tumbled out of his bed on tall, lean legs and strutted into his office.

"Morning," she tilts sleepily, rubbing her eyes then draping an arm across her chest to grab her bicep.

Her breast round at the top and he licks his bottom lip.

"Morning," he coos back,

"Are you busy?" she approaches his desk carefully, walking between the sofas to arrive head on,

Dain beats his fingertips against the tome he'd been dissecting, "Only waiting for you to wake up."

"I'm up," she chirps,

"Come here," he invites, swiveling towards the glass walls in the chair as she descended the skies to him, "You look good in that. You should keep it."

She watches his hands slide up her thighs with a delicate flush, "Can I?"

*"If you don't I'll report you to leadership."* he grumbles.

She rolls her eyes but the blistering pink that shoots across the top of her cheeks and nose betrays her, and he takes her hands in his, pulling her between his legs, 

"Dain." she scolds.

"I love hearing you say my name." he declares against the back of her hands, he kisses her knuckles, "Are you hungry?"

Sloane thinks for a moment with her face turned up, "I would love tea."

Dain leans back in the chair, "Not coffee?"

"It's not for me," her shoulders bounce with indifference, "I grew up drinking tea with my mom,"

"What kinds?" he prods; the House of Mairi had been a high house, he didn't doubt her taste would be exceptional,

"Vanilla Rooibos, with ginger. Blood Orange Yuzu is my favorite, but I like citrus chamolion too." he watches her eyes come alive as sleep escapes her,

"I only take my tea *piping* hot."

She pulls Dain to his feet, tugging his hands with her and leaning back to prompt his follow, 

"I'll remember that." he promises her,

Sloane leads them to the bathing chamber and turns her back to the door, sandwiching herself between him and it's entrance.

She unzips his flight jacket and lets it fall to the floor with a single shrug,

"Bathe with me?"

He'd *drown* with her.

---

They eat breakfast in his suite; Brennan has it carted up with a numbing salve and coughing syrup, and Dain requests the floor aide retrieve Sloane's satchel of clothing from her barracks room. He brushes his teeth in the bathing chamber behind her, watching as she slides her toothbrush around in her mouth. She changes into her sparring uniform while he dons a thick black shirt and heavy grey trousers. He pulls on a pair of tall boots, and Sloane stares,

"You somehow look like a young lord whenever you wear anything that isn't a uniform." she tells him, she pulls his waistband to the side to feel the fur lined insides of the pants. Sloane lets her thumb trace the line of his abs into his belly button and he shivers,

"Is that a good thing?" he mutters.

Sloane grins, "I think so," she collects their plates from the serving table and deposits them on food cart and wheels it back into the hallway, "So... how exactly do you spend your med-leave?"

Dain grabs a black, sheep-wool coat that Brennan had given him and slides it on.

"I go see Cath in the courtyard first," he grabs her waist and kisses her, "bond is still funky."

He kisses her again, right on her nose, then again after seeing it wrinkle.

"Then?" her face adopts the same strawberry hue as Thoirt and she fists the front of his coat.

He kisses her again, this time with his head slanted, and drags his teeth against her bottom lip as he pulls away,

"Then I wait for Dòrainn to show up."

Sloane presses her palms against his chin and pushes his head upwards, "And after that?"

"Today's sunny so I'll go to the facilities sector and help with laundry while the two of them argue in the valley. Then, if my body will let me, mount up a horse and head into the northern encampment to check on the Poromish settling down there."

She bursts into a fit of laughter, "They fight?"

"Over nothing, for no reason." Dain groans.

It actually might not have been nothing though—there was a look Dòrainn would set on him occasionally that made him feel hopeless. It had always been fleeting, but that milky white eye would find him, and Dain could swear he felt *sorrow.* He found himself itching to beg Cath to mediate a proper conversation more than once, but he knew it was boundary his swordtail wanted to maintain. He didn't even like Dòrainn being around them, at Dain's insistence he allowed the morningstartail to shadow them like a chronic illness and that was exception enough for Dain in regard to Cath's tolerance.

"It's nice of you to help out with the refugees." she sings him casual praise with a smile handcrafted by Amari, "I'm sure they really appreciate it—and why laundry?" 

As they tumble out the suite Dain presses her into the hallway at the small of her back and closes the door behind him. He starts a manageable gait to the Grand Hall, "They've been through a lot. They deserve every bit of help they can get."

He thinks about the laundry service.

Being outside on a grassy hilltop bathed in never-ending sunlight with the sounds of sheets and clothing rustling on clothing lines. The smell of fabric soaps shifting with the winds and laughs of the staff rolling through the valley; he felt infinitely at peace, folding, carrying, drying different articles methodically and repetitively. Almost *mindlessly*. He could glance up at any moment and see Cath, and now, usually, Dòrainn too, spiraling in the clouds overhead or basking on a hill nearby.

Cath could go on for *hours* about old dragon law, the shortsightedness of the current Empyrean, his lineage, his expectations for Dain and his worries for the future—sometimes he would harp about the other scaleless hatchlings (humans); peeling his peers apart for all they were worth. 

There had been one or two days when Dain had been more freshly injured and fatigue had sown into him; he'd just trudged over to the two Reds and fallen asleep against Cath's chest. Hushed by the sheets fluttering in the winds, by the slow, stupendous beats of Cath's heart and his heavy breaths, and woken up to the setting sun and Brennan's disapproving face from afar.

"You'll see." he grins. 

She agrees, hours later.

"This has been *really* nice." 

The sun's nearly ready to set and they watch Thoirt, Cath, and Dòrainn from afar, standing between wooden stakes of hanging fabrics.

Sloane learns about the very intentional methods of laundering; the process of preparing large amounts of water in wood and steel basis, built-in floor within the facility. She watched wide-eyed as retired fliers with common signets proudly put their magic to work in the name of cleanliness and organization: water-wielders filling the basins, or curing salt water retrieved by their dragons from the ocean, fire-wielders heating said water and mixing in a concoction of sanitizing powders and cleaning soaps that smelled like powder flowers and light perfumes.

Her eyes never left Dain while he flitted between staff, helping to hang smaller articles of clothing and pillow cases, folding dried uniforms and carefully sliding them into clean retrieval knapsacks that were then organized by claim date at the entrance of the facility. He feels *claimed,* grinning like a fool while being blasted by wind-wielders while holding out bedsheets and uniforms for drying.

Dain is teased ruthlessly by the veterans around them, and civilians alike, his face blazes as they press at the hickey's left across his neck—his swollen lips and the "bedroom eyes" he chases Sloane across the valley with.

"I feel like I could do this for hours." she admits, pulling her hair behind her ears; there's always a coin's worth that she misses, and Dain finally goes after it.

He tucks it slowly against the shell of her cartilage, and runs his thumbs down the skin behind it,

"Me too." he watches it bounce back to the side of her face and frowns,

"Thoirt's hardly said a word to me since they all gathered over there." she muses, tucking it herself this time and it stays until a breeze misplaces all of it and they both laugh.

"Cath too." he sinks his hands into his pockets, he glances over at their bonds, and sees Dòrainn tucked up to Cath, who flicks his tail aggravatedly at his closeness.

"I wish Cath would tell me what Dòrainn is saying more often."

Sloane glances up at him, "Maybe Cath thinks Dòrainn is trying to steal you away from him."

"I don't think so," he tilts his head at them, "It's because he's mom's."

"Because he wants to talk to you about her?"

Dain lifts his head up to the sky. It didn't matter, because Cath didn't want him knowing about her and he'd been pretty indirectly-straightforward about that days ago.

"He thinks my own truths will kill me, and so, says absolutely not." he yawns.

Sloane lifts a golden brow, "That's definitely your dad, not your *dragon.*"

He cocks his head down at her, "I *happily* accept."

"If you don't mind me asking—,"

Dain removes a hand from his pocket and threads it with hers, pulling her closer to him. He keeps his eyes on Cath, who watches him from behind Thoirt, "I'll never keep you in the dark about anything, so *just ask*."

She looks up at him then follows his line of sight back to the Reds, blinking when he begins a slow trek across the valley to them,

"What happens with General Aetos for this?"

"Well... I imagine Reds not bonding is a huge issue; since black dragons are few and far in-between as well. But I'll be honest, I really don't care." he tugs her hand and they begin to cross the valley to their dragons,

"About the bonding?" she gapes,

"My," Dain sneers, "*dad*. I'm not sure what role Cath plays in dragon politics but I'm assuming it's an influential one to call a consequence like that."

"Reminds me of the quorum before graduation."

"He definitely instigated that."

"I had a feeling." Sloane agrees sullenly.

"Does Thoirt like me?" he asks sheepishly as they close in the last few meters before them,

"She likes Cath?" Sloane tells him, "But I could ask her for you."

"Would it bother her?"

She points at Cath and then back to him, "Nope. Probably not. She's always all *Cath's here,* and *look how well behaved his human is,*" she rubs her arms and gags,

Dain frowns, "I am well behaved."

"Yes, you're a good boy. I got it." she croaks, rolling her eyes and stepping out ahead of him to stand in front of Thoirt, "Hey Thoirt,"

The strawberry Red blinks at her affectionately, her eyes zip to Dain for a fleeting second before refocusing on the tiny blonde.

Cath's head snaps to his and Sloane jumps.

*"What are you doing?"* he chitters,

*"Requesting permission to ask a question."*

Cath drops his chin against his outstretched forelegs.

He's okay with it.

Thoirt lowers her snout to Dain, sniffing him the same way Dòrainn had in their den, ripping up his coat and hair.

"She says 'you may,'" Sloane giggles, "but—,"

*"You will show fealty."* Cath says in synchrony with Sloane, and presumably Thoirt. He fixes his coat then Dain stands something akin to attention, sliding his left arm bent at the elbow behind his back and his right fisted over his heart, he bows deeply and:

"Good evening Thoirt,"

"She says good evening back." Sloane interprets, hands on her hips and her plump lips pulled into a full grin,

"Dain Aetos," he inhales, reviewing the proper pronunciation of Cath's name in his mind while folding at the waist, "Cathachadh's bonded—I beg your forgiveness for the insolent request."

"She says you're forgiven," Sloane chuckles, and adds in a lofty tenor, "and that *'you may raise your head'*."

He stands, careful to slowly ease into a more informal stance, "I would like to ask for your permission to pursue Sloane; traditionally Navarrian men request this from their beloved's parents—Cath has never been less than a father to me, and I'm sure its the same with you, for Sloane."

Sloane sputters, choking, absolutely fucking red and her hair flipping over her shoulders in a gentle, wafting gust, and she turns to Thoirt then back to him,

"She asked, why?" she squeaks breathlessly.

Dain turns to her, dragging his eyes through the grassy floor beneath him to his favored's quaking sapphire lakes,

"Because I'm love with you."
