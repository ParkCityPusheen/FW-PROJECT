Basgiath had fallen short in their curriculum the Rider's Quadrant in more ways than one—especially in regard to navigation, survivability, and situational awareness, where they had all but completely failed the cadets. Dain had always noticed it; the inclination to rush forward with bold predictability, with arrogant clumsiness. They lacked pessimistic values that created second and third opinions, they laughed in the face of those with pensive nature, they assumed they were untouchable with dragons and the magic lent to them.

Cath kept him infinitely humbled and _sharp._

The smell here was different than the _typical_ interrogation cell. It was heavier, earthier even, so wherever he was there was the damp existence of moss and plant life that thrived in dark crevasses.

His skin felt waterlogged with bruises, too swollen to stretch anymore, and still tender where the lash marks split anew each time he shifted. One rib moved when he breathed—it wasn’t broken, not entirely, just unseated. Unstable.

His knees blistering against a cold floor that hummed at odd ends—possibly placing him beneath the bell tower he and Violet watched Red dragons spiral around—the trickling of his own blood from the corners of his mouth that dropped into a pool beneath his chin and echo that bloomed throughout the cell he was confined to.

Every drip echoed farther than the last, as if the puddle were widening. The hum rose and fell irregularly, not like magic—it was organic, or mimicked it. Something alive nearby? Or something hiding?

He couldn't see, and couldn't muster the strength to even lift his head up to see anything besides the torn leather and broken skin across his thighs. His head simply shook side-to-side in a pathetic attempt to stay attentive and aware, counting the seconds between the humming—

—three-thousand six-hundred seconds, a complete hour.

When his father speaks again Dain nearly scoffs at how oddly they're both stuck on the time passing by.

"It's been three hours, son." He croaks over the unpleasant sound of his chair scraping against the wooden floor before stopping directly ahead of Dain.

Of course it's actually been three hours. Clockwork cruelty. The man could always keep time, just never his temper.

"And, you haven't said a word."

Dain remembers now, he counted through the first session: he was being beaten for an hour-and-a-half at a time, then mended enough that critical injuries wouldn't impair outside of agonizing discomfort. If this was the third hour Nolon would be returning to assess Dain's injuries and beg his father to stop tormenting him.

He can't see, but he knows his father is taking a seat ahead of him.

"You don't have anything to say?"

—even if he _had,_ speaking was impossible; his jaw was broken and lodged open at an angle.

The General bends down to lift Dain's face at his jaw to face him and the unavoidable pain bursts through him so rapidly, so _painfully,_ that it earns his father a tortured groan through the entirety of the movement.

"We'll be moving locations soon. Can't stay one place too long."

_Gods_ he can barely make out the damn words over this fucking pain.

He feels his eyes flinching from left to right as his mind works desperately. Why would he ever move a prisoner? Those who entered interrogation chambers at Basgiath didn't leave unless they were dead or cadets—or _dead cadets._

Maybe it was his time?

He furrows his brow.

No.

Cath would claim his final hours.

He retreats back to his mind, seeking the wasteland for the umpteenth time and finds nothing but the empty space he'd been born awake from after every sleep.

"I know you and that demented-beast you ride have been speaking with the Empyrean."

Dain flinches; the heavy door to the space creaks alive for a solid five seconds. He recognizes the soft prod of Nolon's cane against the floors, the hitched shaking breaths he takes as he gets closer to them.

"His _eyes_—Alloces, my Gods, what have you done—"

"You may _think_ he can save you, but you fail to understand that those dragons are as guilty as they'd claim the humans around you to be."

Nolon's tired hands cradle his face, thumbs rubbing across his cheeks as his signet sows the torn and obliterated optic nerves, shushing him as his jaw snaps back into place and his teeth repair themselves.

Somehow the mending hurts worse than the initial pain.

"Dain, I allowed you to live as much as they did. Though at first I'll be honest, I wanted nothing to do with you considering what your mother had become—willingly."

Dain's eyesight returns to him in circular blurs and as he blinks away the vignetting of loss from his peripherals, he speaks for the first time in three hours.

"Don't fucking touch me, you sick fuck," he bites, his voice raising with the pinches of pain from the freshly mended wounds. "Get the fuck away from me _now._"

He knows he shouldn't be surprised; he's the only mender on campus. Of course his father would enlist his help in the unwinding of his own son's life. And it’s worse because he knows Nolon doesn’t want this. It’s in the tremble of his hands, the way his breaths come out in starts and stops, but still—he stays. Still, he does it.

He wants to spit on him and makes the move to, but he doesn't even have the strength to spit through the pain, so blood and mucus dribble out of his mouth like he's a poorly functioning child.

Nolon, shakily—Godsdamn him—wipes it all away with the back of his hand.

He doesn't look away when his father stands, when his chair slides behind him at the speed of his rising. He doesn't look away when Nolon's cane whistles through the air and crashes against his mouth—when his lip bursts and his teeth scatter across the wood like chipped porcelain.

Now, he swallows a mouthful of blood, thick and warm, and he _smiles._

"Whatever she became was still more human than you could ever dream to be."

Alloces tilts his head, curious. “Tell me—do you ache for it yet? The power. It's always the weakest ones who burn for it the loudest.”

"No." He tears his vision over to Nolon, who staggers for his cane when it's thrown across the cell.

Alloces kneels.

"It's in your nature." Alloces's head bobs. "To seek and destroy."

He doesn't speak, so his father continues.

"You’re just like her—your mother. And like Violet. Like that traitor's spawn you worship from afar. All of you play at virtue while your hands drip red.”

Dain laughs. "Keep them out of this."

“You groveled after Violet like a dog with its belly up—while she bared her throat to the enemy and dared _you_ to call it loyalty. You weren’t just replaced, son. You were forgotten.”

Dain's eyes glide shut.

"Xaden is a good man," he growls.

Xaden hadn't let himself be groomed behind the privilege of protection in exchange for the lives of thousands of innocent civilians. Xaden followed in his father's footsteps no matter what the cost, no matter the sacrifice—but on his _own_ terms. Xaden Riorson was a free-thinking leader. Xaden would protect Violet no matter what he had to become.

Himself?

He finds Sloane sluicing through his thoughts.

He thinks of her sprawled across his bed in his shirt, her golden hair catching the sheets around her waist and the strength in her thighs. He recalls the cool touch of her bare legs against his hand and the feeling of her signet passing in ripples through his body, the clear, summer lakes of her eyes and her long, feathered lashes hiding them. The _feeling_ of her vulnerable and _alive_ against him while she slept.

“What?” His father leans forward, smiling. “You’d defend him now? The boy who stole your chosen woman and your place in history? Violet picked him. She fucked him. She built a future on his name—and you held her coat while she did it. And after it all _turned,_ so your expense means nothing? Never thought you'd develop being a cuck as a trait, son.”

Dain flinches as his father's hands seize his wrists—still bound, still shaking. He yanks Dain’s arms up, over his knees, and then farther.

Too far.

“I thought I could groom you, the way Asher groomed you for Violet. My little experiment,” he says softly. “Where did I go wrong?”

—and _further._

"Tell me, when did I go wrong?"

The angle changes again—something slips inside his right shoulder with a grinding _pop_. His spine jerks.

"Alloces _stop,_" Nolon barks, voice cracking.

“You are dismissed,” Alloces snaps without turning. “Unless you can sit there like a proper coward, I suggest you crawl out of my sight.”

Dain’s arms quake—twitch—tear. The tendons in his shoulders stretch past their limit, then give with a white-hot crack like rope snapping underwater and the bubbles surfacing as pain. His mouth opens but no sound comes. His vision whites out for a second. His arms are broken.

"Tell me, Dain, when did you become unhappy with the path I curated for you?"

It takes everything he has to stay conscious. The fire in his shoulders spreads down his arms, threads of agony pulled taut with each ragged breath.  
"When you sent cadets to die in an empty outpost."

He screams next—truly screams, a choked sound split by sobbing breath—as his elbows give way, his arms folding the wrong direction again easily like wet paper.

“When I found out that you were hiding—what you all were hiding—”

His voice collapses under the weight of what can’t be endured. His chin drops. A groan escapes, raw and cracked, more animal than anything shaped by a mouth. His vision pulses at the edges, threatening to collapse entirely, but he clings to the pain—it’s the only thing that reminds him he’s still here.

He gasps it, bleeding and breathless. “...cowards.”

Alloces presses Dain’s hands flat against the floor behind him, then grinds the heel of his boot over his knuckles.

“_Reach,_ boy,” he whispers. “You know how this works. If you don’t channel—your dragon dies.”

Panic blossoms in his heart, through his chest, razors his mind.

_Cath._

What if this is how it ends? Not with fire, or with defiance, not skyborne or victorious in flight—but with Dain quietly unraveling in the dark, dragging Cath down with him? The idea strangles him. That his dragon, who gave him everything—his power, his future, _his years_—might die believing this was worth it. That _he_ was worth it.

That the greatest, most selfless creature Dain had ever known might breathe his last breath waiting for a call that never came.

The bond isn't there, there's nothing there—but he screams into it anyway; screams so hard the words escape his lips in deranged whispers and grunts:

_Please don't try to save me._

_Please find a way to survive without me._

_Please don’t waste yourself._

Because if he’s the reason Cath dies—if his broken, bleeding life is all there is left to show for a love that could have outlived centuries—

Then what was the point of any of it?

What was the point of _him_?

"Do you need convincing?"

He's not sure if he's hearing his father correctly through the pain; his breath leaves his mouth loud and uneven, paired with grunts and shattering whines. He can see the veins behind his eyes and focuses on them so he can hear every acid word leave the man’s mouth.

“When I met her—your mother, I suppose, though she was never much more than a vessel. She was so... simple. Soft. Easy to guide. Easy to break.”

He lets out a breathy chuckle, dragging the legs of the chair across the floor, then lowering himself until his knees are at Dain’s eye level.

“You should’ve seen how her face lit up when I told her about Threshing,” he whispers, voice warm like a bedtime story. “All that _hope_. All that _faith_. She thought dragons were _noble_. That bonding was _sacred_.”

He laughs. Loud, chesty, and manic. His breath reeks.

“So I told her what she needed to hear. Fed her lies about bonding rights. Spun fables about legacy. And she ate it up like a starving dog. Would you believe I wasn’t even ranked then? Just a Lieutenant. But I wore the title well.”

Dain’s jaw clenches—blood, rage, nausea crawling up his throat.

“She bonded a Red,” Alloces murmurs, almost reverent. “Not just any Red—a reject. One that circled the cliffs for years, too old for Threshing, too wild to be trusted. But it took to her, for whatever fucking reason.”

His smile warps at the edges, hands folding in prayer.

“I let them nest together. Quietly. Let her think it was real. Let her believe in a future. She used to hold my hand like I was her _blessing_. I let her _love_ me, Dain.”

He slams a hand against the floor, rattling Dain’s spine.

“And when I suggested a child—she _denied_ me.”

Dain’s eyes go wide. His stomach rolls.

“Then, the whining began. Love. Devotion. She wanted marriage. She wanted _purpose_. I told her, we had a _purpose_. You. You would be the project; you'd be born with a natural inclination to magic. She was from beyond the wards, and I knew.”

He leans forward again, teeth bared in a grin that doesn’t touch his eyes.

“So I took what I needed. Left her with child hoping wherever her genes came from would be stronger than my own. And when she got in the way?”

He shrugs.

Dain lunges—head slams into bone—and they go crashing to the ground. He’s over him, snapping like a fucking animal, teeth groping for flesh, ripping skin from the man who made him. His father flounders beneath him, Dain screeching over him, Nolon gasping in the corner, begging them to stop—why was he still even here?

“Get off me—!” Alloces yells, kneeing him hard in the groin, just enough to flip him off balance.

“Just like that,” he pants, hand clutching his throat, “Just like her Red. Violent. Instinct-driven. She died screaming for a cause that didn’t exist, to prove a point to no one except herself!”

Dain wants to vouch for Dòrainn—the _gentle_ Red who brushed past his own like a giant cat in their den, the one that sat so close to Cath it infuriated the swordtail. Dòrainn who stood over him when he had been the one in danger in the courtyard.

Alloces scrambles up, laughing.

“I reported her to Melgren. Said she was dangerous—a _liar_. Bonded illegally in the Vale. Crossed the border from Poromiel seeking _refuge_. Pregnant with my child because she was a manipulative bitch. They swallowed it whole. There had never been a civilian bonded to a dragon without Basgiath before—not in our lifetimes. And a woman born past the wards and meant to bond gryphons?”

His smile splits his face. Blood drips from his neck where Dain bit him, and he _flicks_ it away from his hands.

“The Empyrean didn’t protect her. They stripped her dragon of his rights, dragged him down like an animal. And when they came to her, to _talk_—she attacked them.”

His eyes blaze.

“She reached. She channeled for nothing. Until there was nothing left. She turned reaching for a dream… and stayed that way until you were born.”

He leans in, voice like a lullaby now, “But guess who begged for her to live long enough to carry you to term?”

He pauses, turning his head for suspense.

“Her _dragon!_”

He grins—and something in it twitches.

“He begged the Empyrean for her life. Argued you might be useful—a catalyst, a case study. Maybe even a solution. Something to use against the venin. Or maybe…” he tilts his head, “a cure.”

Then he lifts a finger and points toward Nolon, who is visibly shaking, breath erratic.

“When you were born, you weren’t swaddled—you were _sampled._ We carved your skin into vials before you ever touched a breast. The elixir we administered today?”

He crouches again, whispering like it’s a secret.

“Hair. Blood. Mixed with whatever healers are good for. Probably aged like wine. You've been raised calling them examinations. _We've_ called it _harvesting._”

“Tell me,” he murmurs, eyes locked to Dain’s, “could you feel Riorson when he started slipping? Could you feel the monster blooming beneath his skin?”

A grin. A pause.

“Do you feel your dragon now?”

He leans close—too close.

“Would he still come for you, if he knew what you were?”

He bends, presses his face so close to Dain’s ear he can feel the smile fading.

“I've so much more to say,” he murmurs. “And I want you awake for all of it.”

He straightens. Snaps his fingers and the door bursts open and the room fills with infantry. Boots, blades, more restraints. His father shakes out the front of his jacket, straightening his lapels.

“Let’s go somewhere more comfortable.”

---

His father's memory is by far the hardest he's ever had to stomach traversing through.

It’s fleeting, and not very detailed—more a residue than a recollection. Which only proves how little it meant to him. How little _she_ meant.

Alloces Aetos stands before a woman kneeling and chained, her cell barely larger than her own body. The stone around her has been drained of magic entirely—dead rock where once there might’ve been life. Her eyes are blood-red now, so saturated with what’s been done to her that they offer no hint of what color they used to be.

Dain feels what his father felt in that moment.

Simple _amusement._

Their eyes meet—hers and Alloces’s—for just a breath. She opens her mouth, perhaps to speak.

But Dain is pulled away before she can.

The only words that follow him back to the waking world come from a place so raw, so final, he feels them crack something inside him:

_“You've taken everything from me, but not him.”_

---

“Wake up, Dain.”

He knows exactly where he is the second his vision corrects itself: the General's Quarters.

More specifically—his office—the war room dressed like a shrine.

His eyes roam the polished walls, paneled in dark wood and lined with ceremonial weapons. Swords that haven’t seen combat since the rebellion. Spears for parades, not battle. His father hadn’t carried a real weapon since making Captain—probably didn’t even remember what a pommel felt like.

Behind him, mounted above the desk, hangs a halberd. Massive, sleek and foreboding.

Its shaft gleams with oiled steel, twin heads honed and engraved. The point? Serrated. Long enough to impale a grown man straight through.

Dain stares at it, doesn’t blink. He shifts uncomfortably in the chair; his body is so weak the back of it is the only thing holding him upright.

“You like that one?” Alloces purrs. “We can use that one.”

He lifts it from the wall like it’s light as driftwood. Turns and approaches Dain slowly, and he feels the air tighten around him like a noose.

“Answer my questions: save a friend. Simple, right?”

Dain licks his lips. “Go fuck yourself.”

“When did Riorson turn? How long had he been living as a venin amongst us?”

Dain scoffs; he didn’t fucking know. Funny thing about him and trust—how it never seemed to involve himself.

“Who knows,” he croaks.

Then Dain’s vision blurs—just for a second—

—the slow ripple of a lake crests over his vision, high and vast, cradled in the arms of mountain ridges that glitter beneath the sun like tempered steel. The air is colder here, clean and crisp.

Cath is there, massive, watchful, coiled lazily at the water’s edge. _Thoirt_ too—her scales glinting in the light as she lowers her snout to lap at the surface. And between them, barefoot and sun-warmed, Sloane wades towards him through the lake with something speared through her glaive—fat, silver-scaled fish glistening in the light.

She’s laughing about something but he can’t hear it.

Her shoulders are relaxed. Her hair is damp, skin kissed pinkish by cold water and summer wind. She smiles like she belongs there. Behind her, nestled into the ridge above, sits a house. Small, but sturdy. Brick, wood, and weathered—like it’s been there longer than any war.

Dain squints.

Is that... _ours?_

He can’t be sure. But the thought slips in anyway: _Does she live there? Do I? Do we?_

He watches her approach. The fish is still dripping in her hand, and he wonders if she caught it for them to share. If they’ll cook it together. If he’ll kiss the lake water splattered across her collarbone away before they eat.

If she’s _his._

If _any_ of it would be his.

If he was ever meant for something that didn’t end in pain and loneliness.

“You want to be like him so badly, do you?” his father grunts, voice crashing through the fantasy like a blade.

Dain doesn’t answer.

Then hands are on him—rough, real—yanking his arms back until his whole body twists. One slips. A pop cracks up through his spine.

“—Alloces no! You don’t know the circumstances that his body—”

Nolon, he thinks. Still here and still breathing and still folding in the face of cruelty.

_How repulsive._

They’re arguing again—he can tell by the rise and fall of voices, the way words catch on breath and spin out sharp at the edges—but it all feels distant. Like listening through running water. Their urgency doesn't touch him the way it should. His body is already folding in on itself in the chair, responding to the pain without his permission, seizing and flaring around the new weight of his arms being forced down, palms now bolted flat against the floor. He thinks he might be screaming. He hopes he isn’t; he doesn’t know.

“Tell me!” his father shrieks, and Dain’s head jerks sideways—too far and sudden. His gaze jolts toward the wrong thing, away from Nolon, and lands instead on—

_Someone?_

He doesn’t know who at first. Doesn’t see them fully. But he _feels_ them—like a crack in the wall he hadn’t noticed until now. A fracture in the room itself. A presence, still and suffocating, like it’s always been there. Watching.

He should’ve realized earlier. Should’ve recognized it back in the cell, when the lights didn’t hit right, when the silence wasn’t empty.

He tries to turn toward them now, tries to see, and everything inside him tears. He rotates at the waist, wrenching through the pain, feeling the scream claw up his throat and die there, strangled. He rips something vital in his shoulder, and then something else, and still he turns, dragging his eyes up to meet—

Eyes.

Not one pair.

Two. Maybe more.

One of them flickers, not with reflection but with purpose—_red_, or something red-adjacent. Watching and waiting. He processes what it means instantaneously.

The halberd’s blade drives into him before he finishes the breath he was taking, and his body chokes on it, the world buckling inwards. His father crouches in his vision again and Dain spits; blood arcs through the air and splatters across his father’s cheek.

It’s the only thing he has left that feels like a choice.

“Fine.” Alloces sneers while Dain searches his eyes for that same sickening red, though there’s nothing—not a single indicator that he might be the same as the others observing in the corner.

His father releases the halberd’s shaft and it forces Dain to lean forward with its dropped weight, slicing upwards as he raises to a seated squat above the chair to avoid more damage to his navel.

“Let’s do this like Lillith and Riorson then?” Alloces claps, sharp and brightly smiling. “One stab for each member of Violet’s squad. What do you think?”

Dain doesn’t answer. He can’t. The blade’s weight is too uneven and every breath drags him forward while the halberd answers by carving deeper. He tries to shift, but the pain stuns him mid-motion—his spine bows instinctively.

He’s still trying to hold himself up, even as his body gives up beneath him. The blood seeps faster now, thicker than before. Wet in ways that feel _permanent._ Dain stops listening. His body is too far away now. The pressure in his head builds, and builds, and then—nothing. Just silence.

But this time, he doesn’t fight it.

Not this time, or the next.

...or the next.
