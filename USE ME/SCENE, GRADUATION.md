He reenters the bathing chamber then stands ahead of her between the couches in front of his desk, "Wanted to be home for Solstice?"

"I wanted to be with you." she says, "I left right after the graduation ceremony speeches."

“You...” His voice drops, like it’s been pulled from somewhere deep in his chest. He blinks once, then again. “You flew here right after graduation?”

“I did,” she nods, stepping forward. “I didn’t want to spend it with anyone else.”

His eyes drop to the floor, jaw flexing tight. She sees it—the impact—in the way his chest stutters, how he clenches his fists like holding something in might save him from breaking. A flicker of disbelief flashes across his face before she closes the distance carefully, as though if she moves too fast he might vanish. 

"Aren't you tired?" He asks timidly, stuck where he stands watching her turn the edge of the desk,

"Only a little."

It wasn't a complete lie. She was tired, but after spending the last twenty-four hours thinking about him, she's convinced herself he needs to be the one putting her to sleep.

Dain freezes entirely when she snakes her arms through his and carefully presses herself to the front of him.

"Congratulations on graduating." Sloane smiles up at him and his eyes glaze over.

She bites her lip; graduation was also his and somehow the fucking universe managed to take that from him too.

"Thank you, Sloane."

Her name off his mouth in that husky baritone makes her weak and she commits fully to her idea, "I got you a gift."

She eases back until the desk presses against her hips, lacing her hands behind her, chest lifting just enough to make her point.

His eyebrows jerk up; he's noted she's wearing his flight jacket and possibly less, "What is it?"

She nods to the wingleader patch stitched onto his jacket and the realization trickles across his face, skin, and mind like rain.

Dain opens his mouth once.

Twice.

Then he crosses the space between them slowly, deliberately, and lifts the edge of the metal zipper. Sloane watches every vein that rises along the back of his hand and tracks them up his wrist to where they vanish beneath the black sleeve of his blouse.

"Wingleader, huh?" he murmurs,

She squeezes her thighs together before answering. They’ve never stood this close—not with this much tension. His hair is still damp and curling against his forehead, the freshly washed scent of him is insanely intoxicating and it makes her giddy. She splays her hands against the top of the desk and leans back, then lifts her chin up to look up at him,

"Today's technically your last day as one, so..." she whispers, watching as something unfurls in the earthy depths of his irises.

His breathing is forced and deep, and he rubs the zipper pull one last time then drops his hand to his side,

"So, what?" his head dips down to angle over hers, and their lips barely brush—almost touch. The minty gust of his breath feels like an icy chill across her flushed face and her eyelids flutter.

Sloane can feel the beating of her heart between her legs.

“So... it’s your last chance to break one of your rules, wingleader.” she tells him,

She chokes down her last breath and leans back farther onto the desk before taking his hand and placing it back on the zipper, once he grabs it she pulls his wrist down. 

They both watch as the jacket peels open and Sloane bears herself to him.

She analyzes every reaction.

The way he lets the zipper go gently once the jacket is fully open and moves back to fill his vision with the sight of her. She sees the goosebumps peppering his skin, his heart beating in that dip between his clavicle at the bottom of his throat.

He eases the jacket down her shoulders as she slides onto the desk. His hands are always so calloused and she loves that—loves feeling his skin prickle over hers and when she leans into his touch, rubbing her cheek against his hand, he trembles at the sight and shifts his weight.

His throat bobs as his hands trace slowly over the front of her body, whispering down her sternum, across her belly button and then he uses both hands to spread her thighs open.

Dain leans over her against the desk, placing his palms against the wood and shoving his face into the juncture of her shoulder and neck. He bites her, hard, then licks over the skin and pulls her hair out of the jacket with one hand. He runs his fingers through it at the base of her head—and thank Zihnal that she brushed it out because his long digits slide through them like silk and he groans.

"For me?" is all he mutters as he pulls back to kiss along her jaw,

"For you." she answers softly,

He steps back, runs his fingers across the bottom of one of her breasts where Thoirt's wing traces it.

"Show me."

Sloane gives him a look; under the mage lights, she’s certain her whole body must be glowing a peachy pink.

Dain licks his lips, then taps her thigh—gentle, expectant. “Show me what you like.”

"Oh," she shudders, "oh."

No one had ever asked her that before—not like this. Not with patience. Not with this wonder.

"Can that be part of my gift?"

She doesn't answer right away, she let's that irresistible smoke behind the clean cut syllables of his escaping Navarrian accent billow over her skin.

She can sense it—his unraveling, quiet but total. The heat in his gaze is more than want; he's committing himself to her in a kind of aching devotion that scorches through the air between them.  His eyes roam over her like she’s something sacred and impossible—like touching her will break whatever spell he’s sure he’s under. It’s not just disbelief; it’s awe. Raw and consuming. And it drags a shiver down her spine.

She can feel his hands, not even on her yet. She’s wet, aching, delirious, watching this man disestablish his entire character facade—because of her.

"Is that what you want?" she finally asks, softly—though she already knows he does. He’s wearing it like a second skin.

He licks his lips again, "Yes."

Sloane breathes in slow and deep.

She takes his left hand and presses it on her breast, "We were training once, when I was in my sleep wear," her voice hitches, "and my nipples kept rubbing against the edge of the table while you were talking..."

She glances up at him, and watches his shoulders dip, his head tilt back—like her words knocked the air out of him.

"I like the way you grab me in my sleep." she takes his right hand and shoves it against her hip, "After the time you saved me, you grabbed me just like this."

He pinches her waist, thumb pressing into that soft dip to her pelvis—and she gasps. It tickles, just enough to make her twist against the desk with a breathless laugh. Dain rolls her nipple between his fingers and pulls. Heat bleeds through her veins and into her skin. Sloane bucks against the desk, thighs clenching—she can’t help the moan that tears out of her and fills the room.

I…” she gasps. “You—when you kissed me in the archives... I wanted you to touch me anywhere but you only kissed me, and then you just—," her laughter is a feigned breath, "you just walked away and left me like that."

"I touched myself that night." he admits roughly,

"Show me." she hisses, grabbing at his pants,

He looks at her like she just gave him the sun.

And then he obeys.

Dain pulls desperately at the tie of his pants, then reaches into them, unfurling his heavy cock. He's fawn there, smoother than where he is everywhere else—apricot across his shaft with bulging green veins, dark and peachy at his crown. He fidgets as her eyes rake over his length; it's long, and it's thick. She'd braved length before, but this girth and curve?

Never.

She grabs his shaft, sits up straighter on the desk, and drags him between her spread legs. He watches her hand on him like he’s dreaming it. Like he doesn't know if he'll survive the feel of her. He groans again when she rubs her thumb and index finger over his leaking slit.

His face ignites in flame when she brings the hand she fondled him with to her face, pinching her fingers and pulling them apart so they can both watch the sticky web of precum fall from between them.

"Fuck—Sloane." he rasps, running a hand through his hair and placing the other over her own.

She removes hers and places them behind her, leaning back on her arms on top of the desk while he strokes himself. They're slow, twisted tugs that pull the skin taught against him, he watches her for the first few strokes, then throws his head back while he plays with his tip; thrusting it through his fist a few times before snapping his face down again. He collapses over her, pressing his face back into her neck and panting.

"Keep going," she purrs into his ear, biting his lobe and letting her hands wander.

She touches him gently, cautiously as she can; avoiding his sutures as she butterflies her fingertips up the furry trail of hair to his naval. The teenager in her squeals and nearly screams as her fingers are guided by the sharp indentations of his abs to his thick pecs. She mimics his touch from earlier—twisting and pulling his nipples,

"Sloane," he begs, bucking roughly, "again, please."

Her eyes just about roll into her fucking head. 

"This?" she asks, assaulting his neck while rubbing her thumb across his nipple and twisting with the side of her index finger, then pulling hard,

"Yes."

She does. She fondles his other nipple and starts touching herself too. Dain leans almost entirely against her and Sloane's vision is eclipsed by the broad expanse of his chest and shoulders. She's fucking high on the thrill of him, and as much as she is turned on, seeing this desperate side of him makes her feel so powerful she was practically overdosing.

He had always looked so composed.

But here—above her—he’s unraveling, every carefully held part of him coming loose. She becomes frustrated when she can't see him stroke himself and lays flat against the desk, watching as he holds himself up with one arm braced against it, thrusting into his hand.

His pace of choice is slow, but thorough; he doesn't pull away until the base of his pelvis presses against his hand and when it does he pulls all the way out, and over, and over, and over. 

"You like to watch?" Dain mutters, "You wanted to watch me, Sloane?"

He taunts her with his face burnt by his own blush, his eyes lost on everything except her. She runs her fingers through the wet skin between her legs, shivering when he stops his own movements at the sounds of her neglected lust beneath him.

She lets him enjoy the sight of herself for a few moments before squirming,

"Touch me," she commands,

Sloane was thinking he'd mock her movements too but instead he grabs her thighs and pulls her ass over the edge of the desk, drops to his knees, and settles his tongue on her pussy like he's fucking starved. He gets his tongue flat, first, and licks her from entrance to clit, lets her rub herself against it, watching while her fingers pull at his scalp.

She's swearing his name as he sucks her clit into his mouth, he rolls it between his tongue and teeth gently as the sensations pillow inside of her, building pressure beneath her stomach,

"You're fucking soaked Sloane," he mutters against the inside of her thigh, "Were you this wet when you took off your clothes and put on my flight jacket?"

"Since my shower," she admits,

He groans at that—low, wrecked—and presses his face back into her, like he wants to live there. 

He nips the inside of her thigh and sighs, “I’m going to die.”

"Not yet," Sloane hisses, "Fuck me first,"

"Can I?" he asks, eyes fogged, voice heavy,

"If you don't I'll report you to leadership." she snaps,

His laugh makes her spasm against the desk.

Its always so fucking rich and deep and gentle and it undoes her nervous system like drugs whenever she hears it.

Dain sinks a finger into her, "I guess I have to," she clenches around his finger and moans, "But I need to stretch you first."

"No..."

Gods—she's not sure when the room started spinning but it hasn't stopped.

"Just give it to me," she grabs his face with her hands, "give it to me now."

He blinks, looks like he wants to say something, but he obliges her in the end.

Dain grabs himself at the base and rubs his head against her pussy, coating himself in her arousal before pressing his tip at her entrance, he pokes, and prods, and teases until she's holding the edge of the desk with her knees bent and spread wide trying to impale herself on him,

“Slow,” he croaks—his voice breaking deeper, cavernous, shaking through the room like thunder.

Dain grabs her just above her hips and his huge hands engulf her whole fucking waist. They wrap around her like a corset; squeezing her in at the core, applying a dangerous, addictive pressure. He rolls his hips, head falling between his shoulders as he feels her out—pulling back, then sinking in again, slow and deliberate.

He wets himself again with her arousal as he digs deeper, teasing every inch. Their breathing synchronizes when he's finally planted himself as far as he can go—he looks down at Sloane, but she's not there. She's mewling, scratching at his forearms,

"You're deep," she gasps, "you're deep."

Dain strokes her hip bones with his thumbs, "Mhmm..." he chuckles, "you want it?"

"Yes," Sloane breathes, turning her chin down to see where they've been connected.

"Can you take it?" he asks gently as he starts pulling out, "Tell me if its too much,"

Sloane focuses only on the feeling—how he grazes against the softest parts of her, how even half-withdrawn she already aches to have him again. He moans as he pushes back inside of her, slowly, scraping, stretching.

"I can't believe I'm inside of you," he sighs, fully seated once again. He straightens his upper body and leans over her to kiss her.

He moves like he’s etching her into memory. Every inch he takes feels like a vow—one he doesn’t speak aloud, but makes with his whole body. He kisses her like it'll be their last every time their lips meet. He sucks on her tongue. Leisurely explores hers mouth with his.  

Dain is in no fucking rush to enjoy her—and she’s not used to this.

"Dain, fuck me," she pants into his mouth.

Sex was dirty and fast and an afterthought the next day, but with Dain it felt more personal, intimate, a ritual—she feels exposed and explored.

"I am, Sloane."  he whines,

He stands up and finally pulls out—then sinks back in, still slow and controlled, "You feel divine."

"Then fuck me harder," she demands, shaking her hips beneath him.

"No," he bites gently at her jaw, voice low. "Not yet. I want it like this."

He kisses her again and she spirals into oblivion.

She’s a tangled mess of unraveling knots as he thrusts into her mouth and her cunt—overwhelming her with the sheer weight of him. His moans echo in her skull, vibrate down her spine. There’s a dull pain deep inside her, but she welcomes it. Let's it kindle into a devastating blaze, let's it burn her to ashes in its wake.

He’s pressing into where she fucking ends.

"Sloane," he breathes—reverent, craving—pressing her legs together and draping them across his body, "Sloane."

"Dain, your stitches—,"

She realizes he's picking up his pace and stops talking as he leans back for leverage. Sloane watches the ripple of his abs, the dip of them down to his pelvis. He bites at her socks, rips them away with his teeth, presses his face into the soles of her feet as he drives into her relentlessly. He eyes her tits while they bounce to each of his thrusts. She's consumed by the sight of him, the feeling of him dominating her senses entirely, finally.

He rubs his bearded cheek against her ankles as her name spills past his lips in a desperate cadence, her lower abdomen tightens with each stroke; he's penetrating against her where no one had before, consistently and efficiently. She lets herself ogle his biceps, forearms, his veined hands crossed at the chest to hold her legs against him. She touches herself through the gap at the apex of her thighs, because she has to—because everything he’s doing to her is too much, and still somehow not enough.

"Sloane," he trembles, "Can I come in you, please?"

"Yes please," she mewls, "I'm on—we can—,"

He folds her legs against her, slides his hands to her calves and presses her ankles down by her head. "You can take it, okay? Be good."

She’s pinned—folded in half like a fucking book, breath catching high in her chest, every inch of her open to him.

Something in her gut flips, she glances at her feet just past her head and back at him, "Take what?"

Dain lifts himself onto his toes, angling himself to penetrate straight on, pinning her legs flat against the desk at her calves as he plunges into her the deepest, roughest, the wildest he has yet, and she claws at his hands.

"I—Dain!"

She screams his name as he drives into her, hard enough to scatter papers and thick tomes from the desk with a thunderous crash. The desk itself howls in disbelief, creaking and bending beneath them. He glances at the mess, then back at her, unrelenting.

Each stroke lands with obscene precision, every connection louder than her breathless cries. The obscene, wet sound of him inside of her floods her ears, flushes her skin with hot, shivering shame. It's the combination of letting herself want him, lusting after him, and now finally having him that drags her to her orgasm. The sight of him all over her and it not being enough for him, her name past his teeth and off his full lips—the way he closed his eyes after burning a glare through the ceiling of his suite like he had a bone to pick with each God.

His kept curls rubbing against her clit while he fucks her for all she's worth.

Sloane can barely breathe—still she takes him, stretching around him, opening wider with every stroke. Her moans turn to pleading cries as his heavy sack slaps against the curve of her ass.

Her orgasm crashes into her so hard she doesn’t ride it—she’s ridden by it, dragged through it, helpless to anything but the stretch of him inside her and the weight of his body above hers. She twitches uncontrollably, legs trembling underneath him—and still, he doesn’t stop. Doesn’t even hesitate. Letting go isn’t an option. He wants her like this—and he’s going to take it.

There’s no reprieve. Not from his stretch, from his pressure, from the breathless praise he presses into her throat between strokes. She’s overstimulated to the point of tears, and all he does is kiss her and whisper, “You can take it—you asked for this.”

Her head thuds softly against the wood; this can't be her wingleader.

Codex-kisser Dain who had never shown anything outside of manicured readiness and perfectly followed guidelines. If Sloane had known he was going to fuck her into his desk with the strength of some unnamed warlord she would've written a will and taken more leave days to recuperate.

Maybe pushing for more was a mistake.

What had she worried about his health for?

Her mouth falls open stupidly—was walking an option after this??

“I can feel you... fluttering on my cock, Sloane,” Dain grates, voice broken, panting, sweating.

He was floating somewhere behind his eyes, drunk on sensation and barely tethered to the moment.

Sloane watches as he undoes himself; his long eyelashes beating open and closed in rapid repetitions, his thighs spasming against her ass and the muscles of his abdomen rippling underneath his skin. His neck snaps backwards and he pants as he pumps into her. Sloane fixates on the feelings of him engorged and filling her, his cock twitching violently inside her, thick and impossibly tight in the space she’s somehow still making for him.

"Sloane?"

Dain unfolds her and drops her legs off the edge of the desk.

"...Sloane?"

He’s hovering—wide-eyed, sweat-glossed, he seems unsure if he’s broken her while wrangling his own breathing.

She’s splayed across his workspace, utterly wrecked, breath shallow and uneven, eyes barely slivered open.

“Sloane,” Dain whispers, brushing sweat-slick hair from her forehead. “You with me?”

She blinks once, slow. Her lips part, but nothing comes out.

Dain exhales shakily, leans down, and presses a kiss to her shoulder—soft, almost penitent. When he pulls away, there’s still space left behind; her body doesn’t register the absence. Every part of Sloane still answers to him, slow to reshape to itself.

He returns with a shallow basin from his bathing chamber, fills it with steaming water, and wrings a cloth out until it drips slow and clean. He starts with her neck. Then her chest. Her thighs. Every swipe of the cloth is deliberate, tender—slow enough that she could stop him if she wanted to. Sloane doesn’t. Her breath just goes softer, longer.

He washes her one careful section at a time. Between her legs, Dain moves gently, timidly, like an apology especially when she trembles as the cloth grazes her overstimulated core.  He lifts her and she falls against him, allowing him access to her soaked back.

Once Dain's satisfied she’s warm, clean, and not leaking sweat into the desk grain, he presses another kiss to her knee and gathers her into his arms. She’s pliant, weighted and barely conscious, her lashes stutter against his collarbone.

He carries her to the bed, lays her down like it's routine for him.

She's covered first with the soft flat sheet, then the feather stuffed duvet, and Dain burrows in beside her—after stepping away to shower himself, clothed only in a new set of sleeping pants. 

He takes one of her hands as sleep truly overtakes her—faintly trembling still—and starts rubbing slow, lazy circles into her palm with the pads of his fingers. Then each knuckle. Then her wrist. He rubs them all methodically as she drifts away.

He watches her eyes close, shifts closer and rests against the crown of her head.

"When you wake up, I’ll be here,” he murmurs, planting a long, soft kiss against her forehead, “Sleep.”

And she does.

He stands up and finally pulls out—then sinks back in, still slow and controlled, "You feel divine."

"Then fuck me harder," she demands, shaking her hips beneath him.

"No," he bites gently at her jaw, voice low. "Not yet. I want it like this."

He kisses her again and she spirals into oblivion.

She’s a tangled mess of unraveling knots as he thrusts into her mouth and her cunt—overwhelming her with the sheer weight of him. His moans echo in her skull, vibrate down her spine.

Dain lifts himself onto his toes, angling himself to penetrate straight on, pinning her legs flat against the desk at her calves as he plunges into her the deepest, roughest, the wildest he has yet, and she claws at his hands.

"I—Dain!"

She screams his name as he drives into her, hard enough to scatter papers and thick tomes from the desk with a thunderous crash. The desk itself howls in disbelief, creaking and bending beneath them. He glances at the mess, then back at her, unrelenting.

Each stroke lands with obscene precision, every connection louder than her breathless cries. The obscene, wet sound of him inside of her floods her ears, flushes her skin with hot, shivering shame.
