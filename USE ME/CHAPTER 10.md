### [Chapter 10](https://archiveofourown.org/works/63478354/chapters/167265151): Sloane | Denial

Sloane's not one to concede, and she knows this bullheadedness of hers is a shitty trait, to a fault of course, but that didn't mean she _wouldn't_ under the right circumstances. She knew what it meant to read a room and pick apart body language—not that she needed that degree of social awareness to piece together Avalynn's current contempt towards her. She's been avoiding Sloane so well that she damn near forgets to even look for her until she turns her head to speak to the redhead and realizes she's not there.

It had been three painfully slow weeks since they'd spoken (argued actually, so badly that Aaric and Lynx had to pull them apart) and she fucking hated it. Avalynn was her friend and the only other woman in second squad's group of surviving first years; seeing her so easily flit back-and-forth between other squads while managing to to not miss a beat with boys made her molars ache. Avalynn had never been this unrelenting before and what a fucking horrible time it was for her to choose to be.

"So just talk to her?" Kai clicks his tongue at her, "Are you guys trying to devolve into Violet and Cat version two?"

Baylor smirks and turns his head down to peer at Sloane from the edge of Kai's bed, "Yeah don't do that, there's enough going on internally."

Like Garrick and Bohdi missing with a handful of dragon eggs and some dead elders in the aftermath?

Xaden channeling to save them all?

Aetos losing his fucking mind about it and turning into a shell of himself since Violet broke the news to him?

Avalynn too; she straight up accuses Sloane and all the marked ones in the section of conspiring with Xaden as if he ever had any ill-intentions, as if he expired himself to kill all the riders and fliers protecting civilians that day—because obviously every person his signet washed over fucking died. Sloane pinches the bridge of her nose; _no one_ had told her anything regardless. Not Xaden, Bohdi, Garrick, Imogen, not a single one of them. As if she was an unreliable sibling, or someone not in the need-to-know.

"I haven't ever felt so fucking," she stands up from where she lays between Kai and Aaric's beds, "so fucking helpless in my life."

She's close to tears. She can feel it, and the boys can see it.

"They didn't tell me anything! I didn't _realize_ anything!" Sloane's voice cracks, and she makes eye contact with Kai who shakes his head at her and opens his arms to receive her.

Her brain flashes to Violet vividly describing Aetos's reaction to her unveiling information that Sloane should've known as well, and wonders if this is how he felt. She wonders if her _siblings_ even knew.

"You fucking manifested shadows! It should've been so obvious to us all at that point—you're their balance to Xaden!" her gestures are heavily dramatized, and Kai keeps his arms open,

"Lynx isn't even seeing the surface of what Xaden was capable of Sloane, it could be _anything_ else." the flier suggests,

"I mean," Lynx begins softly, "I should've known, you're right. But I was so fucking scared I didn't think about it." He makes his wispy shadows shape a head sized heart between them that thrums at the edges with thousands of rotating spikes,

"He helped me and I think about him _every_ time I wield. He didn't hate me for it, didn't waste a second guiding me, he just..."

The room is quiet for only a moment.

"He would never hurt anyone he didn't need to. As terrifying as he is." Baylor adds, rolling onto his side away from them to stare at his homework,

Sloane's anger peaks, "I know that! You know who doesn't? The one person I _really_ want to talk to about!"

"Then go apologize Sloane," Kai shakes his head and his hair bounces at the movement; he's been growing it out and those short buzzed spikes are turning into locks that want to be curls, "It's the only thing you haven't tried."

It's the only thing she can control now too.

She couldn't influence Imogen and the other's decision to leave her out of pertinent knowledge, and couldn't bring herself to chastise them about it either; especially when Imogen remained looking even more lost than Violet whenever she was alone. The circumstances of the way everything happened was hurting everyone, and fighting about it wasn't something she want to do. She didn't want to be torn apart anymore than she already was. Less she be walking around in a faded listlessness that Aetos seemed to be perpetually stuck in. She caps her emotions and tries her fucking best steam-power her actions with her heated emotions.

_"That's it, Love."_ Thoirt rumbles pleasantly, _"Rage is best weaponized."_

Right.

She'll talk to Avalynn, then Imogen, and Aetos—because what even was with him?

_"The wingleader?"_ Thoirt hums coolly, _"Should I have Cath summon him?"_

Sloane bites the inside of her cheek, _"You can't just make other dragons summon their riders Thoirt."_

_"Who can't? Cathachadh is willing for his den."_

She frowns and rubs her temples, _"I'm sorry, Cathad-who? Cath?"_

Something that feels like a laugh tickles in Sloane's mind, _"Yes Love, Cath."_

"I guess I'm fucking talking." she spits.

"Guess we're going with you." Lynx grins, pushing the shadowed heart at her, causing it to dissipate against her body and leaving warmth in its wake.

"Right behind you," Kai drawls.

"Maybe we can catch that rumored officer fight club that even the _Aretian Generals_ have been attending." Baylor suggests as he stands up, stretching to touch his toes, "It's like one in the morning, so it should be in full swing."

He piques Sloane's interest at that, "A fight club?" she echoes,

"Yup, its been happening since like two days after Aetos rescued Cat—and he's the only Cadet who's been participating, you know, all things rumored at least."

"I'm sorry. _Dain Aetos_ participating in a fucking fight club?" She's doubtful, Aetos would rather be nose deep in a textbook than grunting, sweaty, and bleeding in a sparring chamber—wait, she thinks; _sweaty and grunting?_

"Which sparring chamber?" Sloane practically squeaks, running past Baylor to Kai's room door, "Sweaty, buff men? Avalynn would definitely be there!"

Of course she would: their mutual lust for toned bodies was something that couldn't have possibly changed between them during this period of silence between them.

Baylor grimaces, "It's behind the double doors underneath the first-story stairs." he turns up his nose and adds, "It's gonna smell like dragon ass."

_"Not all dragons smell like ass."_ Thoirt quips indignantly,

_"All except you."_ Sloane hums to her, _"Naturally."_

She smothers Sloane in contentedness that makes her cheeks heat.

"Who cares, lets go."

---

There _is_ a fight club.

There is no _yielding_; they fight until the other is beaten into subconsciousness.

And Dain-_wingleader_-Aetos is on the mat for his _third_ consecutive opponent now.

The sparring chamber its held in is the only one that Sloane had yet to be in. The stone walls have been smoothed to the point that they bear a shine like granite and there are temperature nuanced runes engraved along the tiled ceiling that keep the room crisp like early spring mornings. It's a two story chamber, stairs immediately to the right of the entrance that they all climb with haste to avoid being seen by the only person who would, _hopefully_, care that they're there. The second story is constructed purely for viewing the fight below and they manage to steal a spot against the banister as two lieutenants break away to greet their peers farther down the room.

"I cannot believe what my eyes are seeing right now." Lynx admits, his eyes shine with curiosity like a kitten released into a garden and he rubs his hands through his short, black hair, "There's just no fucking way."

"He's been missing formation, class, and meals to fucking train veteran fliers and riders and then _fight_ them?" Baylor grins, "I guess the stick up his ass was _beat_ out of him,"

Sloane feels her face screwing up; he'd been showing up for her lessons unscathed and only his new-normal levels of exhaustion, and no bruising—it's two in the morning and he's sporting a black eye that seals his left shut and a cut across his face that bleeds and mixes with his sweat and trickles onto his protruding pectorals—

_"He looks better with his chest out, right?"_

_"Thoirt don't you fucking start. Please."_ her face lights ablaze as she continues to observe him and not getting lost in the passing memory of him changing shirts on the terrace just because she'd _asked him to._

Brennan is not to far behind him, squished between General Ferris and one of the fliers in the tandem unit, the one with perfectly even midnight skin and blindingly white teeth. He's screaming Aetos's name as he squares up after being kneed in the mouth.

Sloane winces.

"Oh look, _look!"_ Kai shakes her shoulders, and leans down to speak into her ear over the hooting of their superiors, "Avalynn, four o'clock!"

Avalynn's fiery red hair is shining glossy and scarlet as ever, Sloane squints to make out more details of her; she's dyed the underside of her hair black.

"Okay," she grabs the Lynx and Baylor, Kai is still holding onto her shoulders, "I'm going to apologize for not listening to her. And for slapping her."

Lynx narrows his eyes at her and leans onto her shoulder, "You _slapped_ her?"

"She called Xaden a fucking mass-murderer-in-the-making. Of course I did!" Sloane wasn't sorry, even though she was going to say she was, slander upon any of Liam's friends would _not_ be tolerated. In fact, she'd fucking do it again.

"You might get slapped back if she's like Catriona." Kai warns, then grimaces as he thinks of his senior, "I know she's going to have words once she finds out I've been hanging out with you guys too, _ugh_."

Sloane twists her neck back to stare at the underside of his chin, "She's pissy that they won't let her join Aetos's squadron and still won't let you hang out with us without talking down to you about it?"

Kai looks down and she giggles—she can only see his protruding eyeballs and his nose at this angle, "That's Catriona for ya." he exhales harshly, shrugging.

"Go, before you lose your self-bolster." Baylor chuckles loudly as he pushes her to the left at the small of her back; they give synchronized thumbs-ups while she struts to the opposite side of the chamber. She steals glances at Aetos down below who stills sustains on the mat, his mouth is open wide as he struggles to breathe and when she looks back up she chances Avalynn's red hair glittering between shoulders.

Shit.

_"I would say keep your eyes one the prize but it could either."_ Thoirt pokes,

_"Should I tell Aetos that my daggertail practically drools over his dragon?"_ She threatens, foolishly though, she realizes when Thoirt replies with dry amusement,

_"Who wouldn't?"_

She shivers at the thought of Thoirt and Aetos's silent dragon—never mind she _doesn't_ think about that. _Gods no._

Avalynn beelines for the stairs and Sloane breaks into a sprint, "Wait, Aval—!"

The redhead shoves her against the wall just to the right of the double doors, silencing Sloane's voice in the otherwise quiet hall: the sparring chamber is sound shielded.

"Are you stupid? This is the only place to prospect proper lays Sloane!" her eyes are live, thrumming with energy, _horny bitch._ Leave it to the rider's quadrant to be absolutely unhinged animals that get aroused at the sight of beating each other nearly to death. She groans inwardly knowing it includes herself, but Avalynn is in a good mood and Sloane doesn't risk a millisecond.

"I'm sorry I slapped you! I'm sorry I didn't let you express yourself—," the words come out rushed and much less polished than she scripted in her mind on the way here, 

Avalynn hugs her, squeezes her tight between the wall and herself, "Thank you." She steps back and laces her fingers behind her back, "I didn't know how to... apologize for attacking your..." She runs her hand along the relic on Sloane's forearm, "Your family."

"Their _our_ family, Avalynn." she chirps,

"I can't be mad right now, I can't be bothered." Her familiar brown eyes glaze over with spilling lust, "Did you see Aetos? _My Gods._"

Sloane tucks her chin in guarded suspicion, "We need to talk about our argument not our wingleader, Avalynn."

It's a damn lie that she'd rather not watch Aetos's tight body flex and bend under the dim mage lights of the sparring chamber. That she wouldn't mindlessly drink in the dusting of brunette hairs across his chest and fading down his navel into his sparring pants. She grinds her teeth down in lame attempt at not replaying the thick cut along his jaw when his head snapped up after being kicked.

Avalynn secures her hair into a low ponytail, "We can, but what if we do it back in the sparring chamber? Enjoy the view?"

Sloane grins, "Fine."

Since Avalynn wanted to, _fine_.

---

All of the first years in second squad keep their eyelids pressed to the back of their skulls in case their wingleader descends upon them in unadulterated fury; they know _he knows_ that they were collectively out past curfew. Allegedly though, Dain Aetos has other things he needs to be doing, and Cath soars sluggishly in the clouds above them with Thoirt during weapons training. Their instructor is a heavily uninvested, retired Aretian rider who provides supplemental lessons to fill their schedule outside of runing classes, which, as of today, were their only priority since Basgiath called on normalcy to return to the Cadets' schedules; no more dual-schooling.

_"What are you guys even talking about?"_ Sloane whispers against the twinkling pink streams of air that braid and bend in the shapes of Tyrrish knots from a crack in Liam's bedroom door in her mind, _"Dragon stuff?"_

Thoirt hums thoughtfully, and returns the feeling but with maturity and wisdom etched in her words, _"Presently, his bond."_

They seem to only really talk about Aetos when they talk and Sloane can't help the childish jealously she feels deep in her heart.

_"Do you ever speak about me to Cath, or just... Aetos?"_

Thoirt's quiet, but ties their bond into a knot that symbolizes faith in optimism and curiosity; _the young lovers' intercession._

_Huh._ She used that with the wrong context, Sloane thinks as Cath suddenly breaks away from Thoirt.

"Hello? Earth to blondie?"

Avalynn's shrill Navarrian tilt snaps her out of her mind, "Talking to Thoirt, sorry."

She flicks her wrist and her glaive rotates once, twice, and third time into her left hand behind her back.

"When the fuck did you learn how to do that?" Avalynn gapes, she glances down at her shortsword as if it's unsightly, "You look sexy when you do that."

"Do I?" Sloane smirks, "Rhiannon taught me this two days ago,"

She snaps the glaive across her waist and misses the staff on purpose, shimmying sideways as it juts out against the valley ground and ahead of her. She spins, halfway, before grabbing it and thrusting forward, "Lethality. If my opponent loses their balance their intestines get skewered."

Avalynn and Thoirt speak at the same time:

_"Oh, my Love, here comes the wingleader."_

"How'd you even end up picking a glaive?"

Sloane's focus shifts to Cath's returning figure, "Shit."

"What?" Avalynn hisses,

"Aetos is coming."

On cue, Cath descends upon the valley; he's always been one of the largest Reds she's seen, but overhead as he soars above them to allow Aetos to dismount perfectly ahead of the sparring class, he's a monstrosity. Not like Codagh or Tairn, but _still_.

"What did you do?" Sloane hears Cat lace Kai with a string of scalding reprimand and when Sloane blinks in his direction she immediately notices Lynx, Baylor and Avalynn all peering in Aetos's direction from across the valley where he has dismounted Cath, who's hovers closely behind. 

Rhiannon's voice carries over them, booming a clearly given command with the eased use of lesser magic, "First years, squad two, report to your wingleader."

She announces it like it's indifferently but the scowl ruining her oval face and the scrutinizing eyes she pierces each of them with, say otherwise. Imogen stands next to her and only offers a slightly concerned brow to raise at Sloane.

Aetos's face is placid and devoid of emotion, even as he speaks when they're close enough to make out each other's facial features.

"Busy night?" he rumbles. His voice is gentle, it is by default, but rough. He needs to clear his throat. He bares no bruises, no cuts, not even a blemish besides the deep scar that cuts through his jaw where the hair doesn't grow.

They all shuffle uncomfortably and Cath unintentionally permits them a few moments of invincibility while he lands behind them and stomps up the valley to settle right behind Aetos. He sits down like a cat and peers at them all, stopping at Sloane to blink it deigned interest.

_"Cath sees you Love."_ Thoirt... giggles?

_"Yes Thoirt I'm sure he sees the whole fucking valley and all of us in it."_ Sloane bites sarcastically.

Cath's scales bristle slightly, lifting against his body before settling again as he bows his neck and tail around Aetos as if he's going to drop open his massive jowls and speak the common language to him. Aetos is just barely the a quarter of the size of Cath's smallest talon but the way his swordtail regards him in their chosen stance, makes him seem _imposing_.

"That's _hot_." Avalynn grunts in a hushed contralto,

"Cadets?" he groans,

"Did you get any sleep?" Kai blurts suddenly, rubbing his arm,

Sloane curves the question like a sickle, "Yeah, did you?"

Her wingleader doesn't look disheveled in the slightest, "I get enough. And manage to keep my GPA safely out of academic disgrace—especially considering the quadrant's standards."

Lynx and Baylor fidget.

"I didn't mean it as an insult, sir." Kai stammers and Sloane's face twists in indignation, "Catriona mentioned the declarative evolution for the squadron is in three days, and you've haven't been around so I know you're busy. I'm just hoping it goes well."

Cath blasts warm air against them, like it isn't hot enough and Aetos rams his elbow into Cath's foreleg as if he'd feel or even notice it. She almost wonders how Thoirt would react to her doing that with how indifferent Cath seems about it.

"Right. It should go well. Thank you for that, Kai."

Kai nods and peeks at his year-mates before blabbering more.

"Are you and her still training together? Her gift?"

Sloane snaps her neck to him and the Aetos.

"You're actually training Cat?" she spits; there was surely no way he'd let that pyscho—

"I am." He fucking _shrugs_ and Cath lowers his head and blinks so lethargically Sloane watches his second eyelid lapse across the gold of his sclera before the scaled one follows. Her anger fades into fear for a moment before redirecting her attention back to her wingleader,

"To do what? _Mindfuck_ you?" her jaw remains unhinged between sentences, "New kink?"

Aetos just points up at Cath, "Unlike you, when I don't train my signet my life gets threatened."

Cath makes a noise for once; a wet, clicking exhale that causes her skin to crawl and makes her wish he hadn't made his sound.

_"He's being dramatic."_ Thoirt insists irrelevantly to Sloane's concern, and she can't tell if Thoirt means Cath or Aetos.

"Why not me?"

She flinches as the thought manifests itself right off of her lips and into his stupid fucking ears. He looks puzzled, probably as weirded out hearing what she's uttered as she is having said it, accidentally of course.

"I'm sure you know not everyone is comfortable with being turned into a book." When she doesn't say anything he takes the opportunity to move right along, breaking their eye contact, "I try to be more lenient here," he pauses, "and lately. It's hard to do when there's two Generals and an entire assembly skulking around at any given time of day."

"We understand." Lynx nudges her, _"Military bearing."_ he hisses, and she bows her head slightly in submission like he, Avalynn, and Kai has.

"Thank you." he deadpans, dismissing them with a wave before turning to look up at Cath, "Mairi stay back a moment."

The minutes pass between them like freshly forged daggers, hot and _sharp_. She watches him with a glacial stare down that makes him fidget, and for just a second he looks boyishly nervous,

"Do you have an issue with fliers?"

Sloane sucks her teeth, "No. Just. Cat."

He cracks his neck and keep his head cocked to the side, "Reason?"

"Because Aetos," her voice is pitched and shrill, and she does her best to tone down her contempt, "Cat just wants to fuck with you, the same way she fucked with Xaden, and then Violet, get a grip."

He blows a soft breath from his mouth and Cath moves to sprawl out behind him, flicking his tail all the while.

"Xaden had something she wanted, and Violet had someone she needed. I don't have either of those things."

"Until she makes you think you do." Sloane scoffs, she throws her hands up at him.

"Catriona can't make me think anything through my own emotions Sloane." The wind streaks over them, gripping sections of his honey-brown hair and tousling it as he watches her indifferently,

Her eyes go round, widening to the point of aching, "I just don't trust her. Especially with you—there's a lot that you know that you probably shouldn't."

He stiffens and his thumbs rub against his pointer fingers.

"Right." he chuckles.

"What are you laughing for?" she sneers, her fists gripping at her sides; she wishes she had her glaive so she could launch it right between his stupid terracotta eyes. She has her daggers but the feelings wouldn't be the same.

_"Love, don't yell, its not ladylike."_ Thoirt begs.

Sloane shields her out, slamming Liam's room door shut.

He lets his head fall back a bit before crossing his arms and Sloane tracks the thick veins that race along his forearms, "You come to my room, lead me on, assume I'm sleeping with another person, get upset that I train my own signet, and don't consider you—as if you'd even volunteer," he cuts his eyes at her, "would you be upset if she offered herself to me?"

"It sounds like she already fucking has." Sloane snarls. 

Of course she has.

Nothing moves with more grace and confidence like Cat does. She's a master manipulator and class-act cunt. Aetos is a haughty good boy; he'd be roped along with his own presumptions if she said the right things to him, if she played the right cards.

"Great answer." he taunts.

"Thank you." her snubbed reply is all she gives him before turning away to rejoin her class,

"Have you ever considered you might have feelings—,"

"Aetos." she turns around animalistically, body coiling, "You don't get to tell me how I fucking feel."

Even though she _was_ actively self-sabotaging herself out of those feelings, she didn't want to hear it coming out of his own mouth. She was trying her best to forget that pure, trusting gaze he held with her as she siphoned his overwhelming magic into Brennan. Unphased and disguising pain he surely felt as she amateurly _ripped_ streams of himself at unfathomed speeds through her and into the oldest Sorrengail. Praying she could find that reassurance he fed to her when she became mentally fettered at the greyed handprints against his skin in someone else. _Wishing_ someone else gave a fuck enough about her to spend days consolidating information about her own signet and then going in blind training her, knowing damn well that it could get him killed. _Gods_, she could cry at the amount of times she tried to let herself be taken to someone else's bed to be held, but the looming acknowledgement that she'd have to give more pieces of herself to find that innocent comfort he'd graced her with was just too much.

It was _revolting._

"I'm not trying to." His body sags against Cath's and he looks at his feet.

"You don't even know what today is because you've been getting your shit pushed in every night. I hope it doesn't have you getting delusional too."

"It's Wednesday." he challenges, the wind tousles his hair and it settles perfectly against his fucking impeccably kept face, "And you should be in your room that late at night,"

"Nice try. It's fucking Tuesday."

His eyes narrow and he shakes his hands ahead of him in dismissive nonchalance.

_What the fuck?_

"Look, I know I might have inadvertently caused you to have a crush on me, but I promise you it'll blow right-the-fuck-over if you keep fucking Cat—like you said you weren't." she closes the distance between the and jabs her fingers against his chest, _when in doubt, deflect._

Cath rumbles behind him and her instincts kick _hard_ at the sound, she begins to flee but he grabs her wrist and twists her forearm up carefully, "Is that what I should do? Fuck Catriona?"

"Stop saying her name like that."

Sloane closes her eyes.

What is this? What the _fuck_ is it about this man that makes her toddle around like some unthinking bimbo? Why when he's not completely enveloped in her attention, does she want to break things like a child? And why is he touching her? That's new.

She thinks of Liam, but she _knows_ he's not the criminal he needs to be for her to displace the gnawing chemistry between the two of them.

He jerks her towards him and catches her at the waist with his other impossibly large hand, "Tell me why I shouldn't or I will."

Her stomach drops past her feet and into the planet's core, she looks up at him, swallowing roughly when she trips into his bronzed irises and sees herself flushed and willing in his embrace; he smells like wood shavings and freshly tanned leather-goods. His gravelly voice is kind and lulling and it's the first time she's heard it accompanied with the rumbling it creates deep in his chest in weeks. She's safe here, she wants to be and she is, and she knows it.

"Tell me." He demands, again, more gently—if he could manage it.

"Let me go."

Why are his lower lashes so damn _long_?

"I won't." he pushes their bodies together and Cath makes one of his noises again, slinging her back to reality,

_"Now."_ she snaps, shoving against him,

_"I can't."_ he mutters through grit teeth; he's avoiding eye contact now.

It's like he's begging her to stay there with him and it makes the situation all the more venomously hazardous; he's always so willing to be hurt. _He's so fucking stupid._

"You will." She bends her elbows, ricocheting herself off of him and he slams into Cath, "It can't work."

"For who?!" He groans, he looks so fucking dejected Sloane has to look away and when she does she walks back to class without risking sinking into oblivion in his soft eyes again,

"For me."
