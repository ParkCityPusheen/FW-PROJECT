Dain doesn't speak when he enters the lecture hall. He doesn't move to look for familiar faces in the crowd, or even past the lectern on the dais, he walks in with the halberd attached to its sling across his back, and sets it on the floor, blade down, with a deafening *thud.* It spooks Professor Devera a bit and she squints at him as she finishes introducing him. It's size is intimidating; the double sided blades are about the size of his chest, roughly, and stick out dangerously from behind him whenever he walks. The sound of it crashing into the floor from the short distance it was dropped is a testament to its demand for strength in its handler. It makes the whole room of cadets bounce, spooked like frightened cats when the sound and the *feeling* of it ripples through the entire room.

"He looks... older." Sawyer observes quietly from behind Sloane "And like he might really punch you for a Codex infraction."

He's clean, donned in pressed and cleaned officer flight leathers and a winter flight jacket, but the inside lining on his is black. When he shuffles to speak with his fliers his body swivels and the squadron patch glints; theirs are metal, not fabric. His hands are wrapped neatly with gauze that's notable under the fingerless leather gloves he removes as he approaches the edge of the dais next to Professor Devera behind the lectern, but when he opens his mouth to speak, a Captain, two of them, pop their heads through the door and speak to him with a familiarity Fourth Wing never achieved.

"Did you have coffee yet?" The copper-headed one asks,

Dain shakes his head no, "Nope."

They approach him slowly and the bronzed skinned man hands him a steel mug which he drinks from eagerly. He sighs and leans over the lectern after taking a second gulp,

"You spoil me." He tells the orange haired captain.

"I know, not as bad as the girls though. Anyway, I need you to breathe when I tell you this."

Dain jerks his head to the seated Cadets, and a square shaped sound shield envelopes them as they speak, Professor Devera becomes included and the cadets wait quietly as they speak, when finally the sound shield breaks away,

The darker skinned Captain scrunches his face in concern, "If you're staying here, *I'm* staying here. And Dórainn just landed today, he's with Cath now. We aren't risking you again."

"Go home to your wives, idiots." Dain snaps, 

"Me too, now we can all be sexless together." The freckled Captain, Thibodaux, agrees as quickly as the bronze-skinned Captain does, "You know how much our big lizards *love* hunting together."

Dain rubs his hands down his face.

Professor Devera nods at Dain and turns back to them, "Cadets, as I was saying: First Lieutenant Aetos, Captain's Abdullah and Thibodaux of Squadron Zero."

"Good morning." Dain begins, "Nice seeing some of you."

"Don't lie," Thibodaux coughs as he sinks into a chair at the back of the dais,

Dain slices through the captain with a fierce glare.

"Flight tactics will have an on field, off field basis; one week will be a flight week and the next week will be a seated week—here in this classroom." he continues,

His honey-brown hair is the lightest she'd ever seen it, and he tugs a hand through his wispy curls that have grown out so much he's got to keep the ends out of his eyes.

"Tell me why I've structured the class that way." He demands, drinking his coffee once he's said what he needs to, then turns his head to say something to Captain Thibodaux,

A few hands raise, including Violet's and her own, but he calls on Rhiannon, and she answers with confident haste, "Wingleader Matthias."

"To have us gauge what we do and don't know about riding with our dragons, Sir."

Since Rihannon stands to speak, the rest of the cadets follow—however unwillingly.

"Yes. What else." His hand gestures at a first year flier ahead of him,

"To review what we're doing wrong and right after the flight week?"

"What *else?*"

This time a rider from Second Wing.

"To give us a break from the flight week?"

A grunt, then a flier from First Wing.

"Are you trying to gauge if fliers can ride with dragons like you guys do?"

He drinks his coffee, then his eyes land on hers.

"Sloane." Her first name is thick off his tongue, a rough purr ringing up from the dais and into her ears with affection that reminds her that he *belongs* to her, that her performance is a direct advocation of where his standards lie—because he chose her, and in choosing her, made her excellence a mirror of his own. There's *no* mistaking the accuracy at which his eyes slice through the room to her. Of course they're narrowed in indifference, but the twinkle against those earthy clay irises and the lift of his lip over the edge of the steel mug as he says her name tells her that he expects perfection from her,

And so—

"In theory, the off week allows you to verbally prepare and expose us to the tactics and maneuvers we will be expected to execute in the field, while the off week will be a trail-and-error period that you'll spend observing and probably grading us. We should do well if we're committed."

—she *delivers.*

Simple and effective, the same as Rhiannon. As she sinks back into her seat he grins, then he points to Violet and it dissipates,

"Your Grace?" He blinks, but offers nothing else, "you should do well if you're committed, and what else?"

Violet doesn't stand.

She crosses one leg over the other, fingers laced loosely in her lap.

“Because tactics mean nothing if your dragon doesn’t care whether you live or die.”

Her voice is calm. Unhurried.

“You can drill us all you want, but if a rider hasn’t earned their dragon’s trust they'll die. So, the seated weeks aren’t just review. They’re a chance to reflect, to understand why we’re in the sky and discuss it along with them. Once we’re up there, it’s not just about what we know. It’s about who flies with us and if they'll let us fall.”

Dain stands there nodding.

"If your dragon hates your fucking guts, they won't tell you. They'd survive just as well *without* you. It's *your* job to establish a proper relationship with them—whatever that may look like. They should be as present as you are, especially in this class where what I'm teaching you may not be applicable in the way it's presented to you, *for* you."

He pauses, settling his sight on Violet once more, "Sorrengail rides with a saddle, yet her maneuvers as a second year were ones active duty officers still struggle with now—and I've been training them at the outposts so I know."

He points to Sawyer, "Henrick is missing a leg, but if you didn't see him without his prosthesis you wouldn't be able to tell, *especially* when he's riding."

Sawyer blushes, "Awe shucks, Wingleader." And Ridoc elbows him, chuckling.

"Mairi is a weapon." He backs away from the lectern and paces the dais with one hand in his pocket and the other clasping the top of his coffee mug. His strides are long and his posture is *dangerous,* he casts his gaze over Captain Abdullah as he replaces Dain at the the lectern and leans over it like he was.

"She has an arsenal of tools at her disposal: her signet, her weapon, her runes—as demonstrated," his hand whips out and he wills the runes she's engraved into his ring to call his halberd; it rips out of its scabbard in wild rotations and into his palm by the shaft. He catches its perfectly, some cadets have clearly held their breath as it flips through the air, and others gasp when he catches it and the curve of the larger blade stops just beneath his jugular.

The sharp ringing of metal echoes through the room as he finishes speaking.

"Paired with the fierce bond she has with dragon—that I'm sure only a quarter of you have with your own—these are traits she's honed that we'd look for in how how reliable, how impactful, and how trustworthy you are to us as you enter the riots."

He stops pacing to fling the halberd back to its scabbard with just the flick of his wrist; the metal clasps open to embrace its shaft then close tightly as the metals collide and that metallic *ping* rolls through the room again. It's a perfectly massive axe throw, and the room is entranced by him.

He finishes his coffee and sets it down in the table where Captain Thibodaux sits.

"We've delayed the threat of venin as much as I can, so I need you all prepared." He sucks in a heavy breath,

"*We* need you to be the wings for the slaughter."

He points to his patch.

Sloane's heart had worked up to a noticeable pace as his speech climaxed effortlessly, and it crawled up her throat with tiny, molten little hands as the room erupted in cheers and screams. Professors poked their heads in to observe the ruckus he'd created, to hear the Tandem Unit's chant as it bellowed out of the cadets and fliers mouths. Squadron Zero took in the sight; Dain and Captain Abdullah with crossed arms, and Captain Thibodaux behind them, grinning like a fat rat in an open pantry. 

It took minutes for them all to calm down and when they did Dain's ever-so-familiar Wingleader voice razed over them and instantly deflated that heightened morale,

"Your first assignment is a three page, *maximum*, general assessment of your dragon and your bond with them, and why it is the way it is. Get it to your wingleader by tomorrow afternoon; whatever's not on my desk by then is a zero."

His stern glare combs through them at random, "If you fail to turn in more then three assignments I'm dropping you from the course and good luck graduating without it."

"Sir," a rider from First Wing with half pink and blue hair addresses him silkily with a piercing tenor, "should we be calling you Professor, First Lieutenant, or... Dain?"

The simple *audacity* makes Sloane's throat dry with irritation.

"Do you have a preference?" She mewls when he raises an uninterested brow and turns his nose up in mild disgust,

"I'm grading your performance for the semester. What do you think?"

Ridoc whistles, "Good question!!"

"I thought they removed the stick out of his ass." Sawyer snorts,

Sloane sneers, her eyes rolling.

His expression doesn’t shift immediately, but something minute in his posture changes—a faint tilt of the head, a pause too long to be accidental. His eyes breeze over her, seated between Rhi and Violet with her legs crossed and her notebook in her lap and when he speaks, his voice is all clipped precision, textbook articulation honed from years of drill.

“Address me by whichever title best reflects your understanding of the chain of command. I wear more than one, and they’re all correct.”

His gaze doesn’t linger, but it brushes over Sloane like a stray gust of warmth in an otherwise chill wind, softening just at the edges.

“Exceptions,” he adds, eyes locking with hers in a moment just for them, and her face heats when his lips twitch up into a smile, “will be extended _sparingly_ and earned through conduct, not cleverness.”

The room straightens beneath the weight of his tone. The levity bleeds out of the air along with that poised, *perfect* curve in his lips.

“This course is not a theater for improvisation. You are not civilians. When you speak to me, or to any officer, you will do so with the bearing expected of candidates at this Academy. That is not a suggestion—and until you graduate you're a concept of what *could be.*”

The rider huffs and sits down, then Cat's voice floats up from behind her.

"Then, *Professor Aetos,*" she purrs, "what's on the agenda for today?"

Sloane's eye twitches.
