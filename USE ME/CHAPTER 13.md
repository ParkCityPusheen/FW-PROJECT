### [Chapter 13](https://archiveofourown.org/works/63478354/chapters/168230380): Dain | Misery

Dain's seen Reds, but none like this.

A red near-equivalent to Tairn; massive, imposing, terrifying.

He digs his heels into the stone-hewn floor of the den when rerouting his exit proves pointless—the dragon takes a single step ahead of him, blocking his new path—and sucks in a sharp breath before peaking up, just enough to steal a nonthreatening observation of it's face.

Dain's body tenses—this dragon is _battered_.

He's bigger than Cath, about the size of Cam's dragon, Molvic, who could eventually be the size of Tairn. A much brighter red than Cath, and missing all the horns on the left side of his head. His body is littered with so many scars that there are ample inconsistencies in the pattern of his scales and they've healed horribly. His morningstartail lashes around behind him where the spikes are nubbed and a crescent shaped wound gouges out almost more than a third of it. His _wings_; how the fuck does he fly?

He bares his teeth at Dain, leaning in so low the tip of his jaw scrapes across the floor roughly, and shows that he's missing plenty before blowing hot air over him.

The absence of sulfur scenting the air in the cave allows Dain room to convince himself this dragon doesn't mean to harm him; he's curious.

_"Cath?"_ he bleakly croaks through the wasteland, crowding Sloane against him from behind,

_"What."_

Dain's eyes strain, _"What do you mean 'what?' I think someone isn't happy that I'm here."_

_"Unlikely,"_ his bond snorts dismissively, _"bring the one who denies the den owner right to traverse freely."_

"What's happening?" Sloane mutters in a hushed breath; her hair is parted at the side today and slicked down into a tight bun encased in a heavy braid. His attention slips for a fraction of a second as he wonders how she styled it to achieve the look.

"I've got it." Dain assures her, smiling,

There's shuffling behind them but Dain keeps his eyes forward.

_"It is Dòrainn."_

Dòrainn breathes in against him so roughly that their flight jackets rip upwards towards his nostrils, he flicks his eyes up and past them, presumably to Cath,

_"He has not seen you since shortly after birth."_ his Red mumbles,

Dain freezes and his spine snaps straight.

_Since shortly after birth?_

_"He knew my mom?"_ Dain's heart spasms and he clutches his chest.

_"More than the rest of us."_ Cath answers dryly.

"Aetos?" Sloane breathes behind him while tugging the hem of his flight jacket,

He spins around to Cath, taking in his statement before belting _"You're_ my mother's dragon." 

Dòrainn lifts to his full height and growls at Cath. Dain's head swivels back to the battered dragon who regards him with disgust before he turns back to Cath who's scales above and between his golden eyes, shift; _"And where did you get that idea?"_  he hisses.

Dain's mouth tears open and his heart begins fluttering so wildly he fears it may break his ribs in its attempt to escape his chest. His throat tightens and he replays the scene in his head for Cath to see.

_"In my memory, she had a Red..." a kind Red,_ which Dain could not tell if Dòrainn was and, who was _huge and metallic_—which were accurately descried at a glance.

Cath blows hot breath over himself and Sloane, who's eyes flicker between the three anxiously,_"Yes, Dòrainn is a Red dragon, Knight."_

Dòrainn sits ahead of them and lifts his chin, his jaw opens slightly as the only milky-white eye he has burns through Cath.

He's missing his right one.

_"He tells you your name was derived from the letters in his own."_ Cath growls somberly,

Dòrainn strides past all of them but he brushes his body against Cath's as he passes his den-mate. Dain glances down at Sloane; she's been watching them all with spilling curiosity and offers him a wry half-smile, 

_"What does Dòrainn's name mean?"_ he presses Cath carefully, cautiously.

His mother named him from the letters in her own dragon's name, so they were close, he thinks. He imagines what Dòrainn looked like twenty-three years ago, then almost laughs—he probably looked the same. There was no telling his age. And Cath only allowed so many questions per day. He chews the inside of his cheek while waiting for Cath's answer and keeps his eyes locked onto Sloane's blue ones. He anchors himself in the skies of her irises, let's himself smile as he wonders how much love might've been given to him by his mother as he grew in her belly.

Did she ride while she was pregnant with him?

Did she and Dòrainn come up with it together?

There's an imperceptible strain of a single thread in the fabric of their battle flag against the wasteland winds and Dain almost misses it as Cath finally, ruefully, answers his question,

_"Dòrainn's name means existential anguish or pain, grief, and suffering in the language of dragons."_

He pauses as Dain's emotions explode through the bond.

_"And mine?"_

Cath looks down at him with fierce regret and sorrow.

_"Fate."_ he tears his gaze away, _"Or, dead one."_

Dain's abstractions of love and affection devolve into despair, then he smiles.

"Of course." 

---

The trek back to Riorson House he finds himself doing his best to bury Cath's explanations and their paired emotions deep in his heart and mind, somewhere where they could be drowned in the currents of present-day happenings. Somewhere where he didn't float in the reality that _both_ of his parents hated him.

The colors of the environment around him all blend into the grueling greys of the cliffside rocks. They're dull and hopeless.

_"Calm your mind."_ Cath demands as he carefully fits his steps between jagged rocks, _"You did nothing wrong."_

_"My existence is wrong."_ he parries, now drowning, suspended in the darkest parts of his mind,

_"Your existence is mine."_ Cath aggressively chirrs; Sloane pauses at his left, swinging her head around as the sound booms out of the den mouth,

"Are they fighting?" she whispers, "I've never heard of riders entering dens; I think we shouldn't have..."

Dain lets his eyes drag over to her, focusing on her neatly styled bun, "It's fine. We're fine."

"Are we?" she pokes, stopping to carefully place her full attention on him, "Are you?"

"I think I will be." he coughs, voice hitching embarrassingly, "Maybe."

The silence between them snuffs out any chance of small talk until Sloane speaks again as they streak through the tall grass of the valley.

"Cath is your mother's dragon?" she curiously presses, then "You don't have to talk to me about it if you don't want to."

He stops ahead of her.

"Would you tell me things you didn't want to talk about?" he answers her question with his own. Not to avoid hers, but to tell himself that _someone_ wants him in some way.

"I would." her reply is instant, "You wouldn't hurt me, right?"

"I would never." he straightens his back and shakes his head,

"I know."

Sloane smiles at him and he could let go and cry again, but he wants her to see him in a way that made her seek protection and warmth; it wasn't Sloane's job to soothe him, and he was too old to be crying left and right anyway.

_"You are allowed to be emotional."_ Cath rips at him impatiently, _"You cannot be what everyone needs when they need it. Be what you are."_

_"A mistake."_ Dain quips.

Cath elicits pressure masquerading as sound—something perturbed, oozing diseased sentience. There’s no clicking in his roar this time; only a seismic whisper that shrinks his pores as it passes over them. Sloane falls in close beside him but doesn’t let the discomfort show on her face.

Was she brave but scared of Cath?

Or brave and accepting of him?

_"I will tolerate no more of this talk. Do it again and I will fly you into the thinnest part of the atmosphere and drop you near floor until you are indeed crying."_

Dain shields, quickly; Cath has done this before so he knew it wasn't an open threat, it was a _promise_.

"He isn't," Dain sighs to Sloane, "but the Red morningstartail, Dòrainn was."

"I've never seen a morningstartail besides Tairn."

"Same."

Sloane shuffles and breathes slowly, "You wanted to talk about Kavanagh?"

Dain lets his shoulder's relax, "Yes, if you're comfortable with it."

"I am." she begins as a warm wind's fingertips slide across them and Dain doesn't fight the shudder that creeps up his spine as they ruffle the fly-aways at Sloane's hairline, "With you."

"I got a report about First Wing planning a murdering of marked ones in all the Wings."

Sloane's body compresses like a bow string and her head leans forward in disbelief as she puts together the pieces.

"Allegedly since Riorson turned, albeit to save everyone in Draithus or not, the marked ones will all follow in his footsteps. That," he crosses his arms and taps his fingers against his elbows, "is their claimed prerogative."

"Sounds like theirs more to it." she snips in disgust,

"I think there is." He doesn't wait for her to finish, "When Cat and I were talking the other day about the squadron I realized Tyrrendor is being put on a streamline to independence, and should the assembly vote to separate from the forced unification there isn't a time more substantial to do so. Especially after the squadron succeeds and more are established."

"Navarre thinks we'll secede and join forces with the Poromish."

"I think whoever is encouraging this narrative is." Dain snarls, chewing on his lower lip.

Sloane watches him with an aberrant glare that makes his shift his weight, "And how exactly do you figure Tyrrish independence and murdering marked ones are synonymous?"

He keeps his eyes on her, dumbfounded when the sun glints over her through the cloud coverage and the sight of her gilds entirely.

She looks celestial.

"From what I've gathered in undertones in the few assembly gatherings and confabs between the Generals there, combined with the mission statement's for the squadron... I think they've been quietly pushing towards it. Also, the way these murders have been planned are not something Drue would think of on herown."

"But _why?"_ Sloane cracks her knuckles with her fingers, "We're in the middle of a war."

"Riorson and Brennan were the only ones pushing against it previously."

"Violet—,"

Dain clicks his tongue, "She means nothing to them. She'll need people in her corner who they need in theirs to maintain a strong influence. Hence why Cam and I were—sorry, Aaric—have been trying to find ways to inject ourselves in places where it won't be easy to remove us from once we're established."

She circles back, "Who is Drue working with then? She's a wingleader so she's not stupid."

"No, she _is_ stupid, but she's also exceptionally strong. And unfortunately the suspicion is General Aetos; he's always hated the marked ones and hated that General Sorrengail was so impartial to them. He's probably finished what he thought Melgren should've."

He watches the emotions blink through Sloane's body language before settling into rage that makes her curl her hands into small fists.

"How have you been handling it?" He lips mold into a thin line, "I assume you've been handling it?"

"Of course I have."

She rolls her eyes.

"Maiselle has a unique signet that we've been taking full advantage of paired with mine. Tara and Imogen have been helping as well." he pauses, considers the repercussions of letting her in on something so meticulously organized by himself and his executive officer, "I want Iris Drue burned by dragon fire, and I'm making sure everything lines up so that she and her cohorts will be right alongside her."

Maiselle disguises herself as one of the assailants as they discover who they are, with Tara as a witness, then Imogen erases their memory after Dain acquires what he can with his own, then beats them so badly they'd rather forget participating to begin with. The four of them request the exchanging of memories from their dragons once they return to Basgiath and all but Tara's dragon agrees. It's simple in thought but horrendously tedious to execute in person.

"Do you need my help with anything?" she suggests mildly, as if she knows she's going to be turned down.

Dain shakes his head slowly, "Not with First Wing. If you could avoid talking about this with anyone but me that would be great..."

Sloane nods curtly.

"I do need to know why you didn't wield against Kavanagh."

Her eyes break from his and float into the clouds above them, she chews on the inside of her cheek before letting her shoulder's drop.

"I think, for a second, I thought it would be easier for me to just stop being. And that second should've costed me my life."

He looks up at the clouds and closes his eyes when he captures a glimpse of Cath, "It's hard, you know—even getting up in the mornings." his voice catches in his throat, "It feels like there's more reasons to stop than to keep going."

Sloane nods, "I don't think we can avoid that pain. I think I can utilize it better, to do better for myself."

"The pain," he looks down at her and _sees_ her alone just like him; no family, just discovering friendships, cast into a life chosen for her, "The pain is inevitable, but the misery is a choice and if I'm going to be alive I want to be.. you know, happy."

She moves to stand next to him, staring up into the clouds where Thoirt and Cath wind around each other through clouds.

"What does happiness look like to you?" her voice is gentle and somehow broken,

"The eradication of venin." he deadpans, "Then a house. A house in the mountains somewhere with a lake and plenty of property..." he glances down at Sloane; he hadn't let the words pass his lips before and they made him feel vulnerable and shy, "so Cath can make a den nearby. I'll fish and have fresh food all the time. I'll sleep in and read a lot. I don't even really need to be emotionally happy. Just safe—_sound_."

Sloane giggles and their hands brush at their knuckles, "That seems really nice,"

"Think so?"

He looks down at her and she looks up at him.

"I do; I can picture it."

"Maybe," he licks his lips and shifts his weight, "we could do it together once everyone is safe."

Sloane's eyes capture the sun's gleaming rays; there are lakes right there in her eyes already—so he didn't need to go far to find home.

"Maybe." she agrees.

Grinning he adds, "It all sounds so simple. But death is right around the corner, all day, every month, every year."

"We'll end it." she amends.

It's her unwavering eyes on his and the way her words leave her lips with haste and confidence that make him finally believe they truly might be able to.

That they might wake up in a house, by a lake, on a mountain.

---

Back in his room she settles down on the floor by the bed and rests her against the mattress.

"I can't get Brennan to agree to train you if you won't even use your signet to save yourself." Dain tells her as he shuffles through the door with a coffee carafe and two mugs, behind him his roommate trots in with a grin,

"Just grabbing some clothes," he flashes his gapped front teeth at Sloane as rips uniforms off their hangars, "keeping my man busy, huh?"

She flushes, "He's my tutor—,"

"He's _something_." Troy coos, his voice a susurration about Dain giving great _private training_ before turning back to Sloane, "You can come around whenever, I have my own _tutor_ that lets me stay with _her_ too, so no worries."

Sloane glances at Dain when his sigh transforms into a groan and Troy bounces out of the room after saluting him, who only blinks slowly as he pours himself a cup of coffee.

"Anyway," he grunts, tilting his chin at her,

"I'll make an effort, outside of our training, to wield." she says simply, "I can do it."

He taps his fingers against the ceramic mug, "What makes you so certain?"

"Kavanagh—," Dain flinches when she mentions him, "mentioned how adept my brother and mother were at the things they were mastering. And he was right, I have nothing. So, I'm picking three: runes, siphoning, and riding."

"Great starting point." Dain drawls, smiling,

"Runes come naturally to me, and I feel like I can really abuse the utilization of them with my signet. I think about how you told me to use you a while back, and how I made Ridoc's dagger explode into a mini iceberg." her eyes scuttle to his,

"I think there's some potential to be taken advantage of."

"If you can apply it correctly I think there is, but unfortunately I'm pretty shit at—,"

She raises her hand, "I don't need you to be good at things for me. I want to show you I can do it on my own. I owe it to Thoirt to do something for myself."

_"If she puts Thoirt in danger again I will relieve her of their bond. The one who needs to survive will."_ Cath promises, _"I have eaten humans for less."_

Nausea creeps into Dain's gut and he refocuses on Sloane, "Admirable. Execution is the only thing that matters then."

"Will you keep training with Cat?"

"I will..." he gauges her blank reaction, "I feel comfortable with her and she trusts me."

Sloane gives him a stiff nod.

"What were you thinking of doing with the runes and your signet?"

She brightens, "Charged bolt heads and weapon scabbards." she makes a motion as if her glaive were in her hands, "The glaive sucks to carry around, but I was thinking if I engraved the right runes into it and then a scabbard I could just rotate it behind my back and have it snap into place."

She claps her hands together to demonstrate the effect.

"So you could have it with you everywhere?"

"Exactly, because right now I'm training with a weapon that's a hassle to get around with and no one else is using polearms. Besides that they're are a bunch of practical usages for runes and I plan on exploiting them all to protect my friends."

Dain puts his mug on the nightstand and sits across from her on Troy's bed.

"Let's plan to have you under Brennan's wing before next summer,"

Sloane frowns, "Brennan is a mender," she assents, but stubbornly, "Why does it have to be him?"

"He was extremely close to a siphon... and that person was also Tairn's first rider."

Her eyes widen

"You didn't know that?" he gapes, "Surely we mentioned it."

"No..."

Dain blinks, "I think you weren't present for a lot of those conversations." he'd since had conversations with Violet about it too, on behalf of his training Sloane.

"You have enough on your plate, especially considering the Squadron, so..." she pulls her knees to her chest, "I was thinking let me handle myself until the next time we meet for training."

"When should that be?"

She wasn't wrong, he needed to focus on the tandem unit, and as easy as it was to sit here with her he needed to see Brennan later and take advantage of this free day too. 

"Next week, in Basgiath."

He groans, "I graduate—,"

"You said you'd _'be right here in Tyrrendor,'_ and if I have to rely on you for every bit of progression that I make, isn't your help redundant?"

And she's right again, Dain concludes. She's fucking _right_.

He just wants to be there for her.

He wants to be there _with_ her.

"All right." he submits, "One week Mairi."
