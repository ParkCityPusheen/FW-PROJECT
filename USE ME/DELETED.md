"I'm never there for him when he needs me." Aaric nearly whispers,

"I'm realizing the same." Sloane answers.

She stands close enough to him that he stops petting Dain and pulls her into a warm embrace.

He's *shaking.*

"What changed Sloane. Why'd you cry earlier—why'd you freak out on Violet?"

Sloane hugs him back,

"I'll have you know," she mutters into his collarbone, "Dain and I have gotten a bit closer than I could've ever imagined."

"Close is what? Like this—"

Aaric steps back and tips her chin up with his hand then crashes his mouth into her,

"—or like *this?*"

Sloane let's him take what he needs before pulling away.

"Did you already know?"

Aaric's signet was the most inexplicably random thing to happen in the last century, especially for himself. He'd seen premonitions of cities being erected just outside the barrens, to flowers growing on the beach in Loysam and the crunch of someone's brown boots over them.

There was never rhyme nor reason, just connections and crumbs to what they might mean. He spent most of his time pondering things he couldn't possibly consider.

"I do." he admits, pressing his thumb against her lower lip, "But I wonder if I could have you both."

Sloane blinks and jerks her head up, "I'm sorry—what?"

"I didn't find out with my signet; I think anyone with a brain could tell,"

"No," she steps back, floundered, blushing, "*You* and Dain?"

Aaric raises a sandy brow, "He's pretty."

Sloane leans so far forward Aaric does the same in mockery.

"You never told me *this!*"

He crosses his arms, and taps his index finger along his bicep, "He likes his privacy. And you were all up in it."

"You're all about the fine print—which means he had to explicitly ask you not to tell anyone."

Dain was too, she thinks, so it might've been a mutual agreement,

"You know me so well *Riot,*" he rolls his eyes, "I won't touch him if it bothers you."

"I—I mean, you should probably consult with *him,*" she gapes, voice tilting with embarrassment.

Aaric turns his face to Dain's blueish one.

"He's never been the possessive type; just happy to be included."

That's all it takes to break the last few pieces of her.

And she breaks as gracefully as she can manage.

"Do you realize how deprived that sounds?" she sputters while flinging her hands up, blinking the smell of medicinal chemicals from her eyes, "Do you know I went to his room because you were gone and slept there day after day and he didn't once try anything weird?"

Aaric pets her the same way he was Dain.

"Why?"

She blinks away tears, "I don't know Aaric; because when he's not irritated, busy, or otherwise talking, he seems so calm and..."

"I get it; we have the same taste Sloane."

"He didn't say anything, told me he had feelings for me, then turned me away to keep *me* safe?"

She shovels air down her lungs and is nauseated by the ease of it; what she wouldn't give to breathe for him right now, to lessen the pain he was feeling from it, "He spent hours putting together notes for me, for *weeks.*"

"Sounds like Dain."

"I treated him like shit Aaric—"

"So you did," he pulls her close and rests his chin on top of her head, "But *something* changed didn't it?"

His arms keep her from seeing him along the cot, so instead she replays the image of him chained to a chair and the floor beneath it, "Not soon enough."

"Any sort of change is progress Riot," he releases her but squeezes her hand in his, "After Draithus, when he found out about Xaden and finished freaking out on Vi you know he cried for him?"

"For *Xaden?"

Aaric leads them out of the room and into the hallway, "Ugliest cry I’ve ever seen—like his face was trying to fold in on itself. I told him if he ever did that in public again I’d stage a medical emergency."

He huffs out an exhausted sigh while ghosting his thumb across her knuckles.

"I would tell you why he cried, but he fell asleep before I could pry it out of him."

"He acts like order will save him. Like if he keeps everything clean and right and inside the lines, pain won’t come knocking.” He runs a hand through his hair, voice lower now, "But it finds him every time. He's known this was coming. We both did to an extent."

"I never realized how evil the General was."

It's all she can manage because *again,* as per her status quo, she knew nothing about those closest to her, nor the boy she wanted to be the closest to. Gods what a cruel life this was, a sideliner by trade and in power. She wonders coldly when her breakthrough would be.

Aaric sits in the armchair Mira no longer occupies, "He killed all of the friends Dain made when he was a first year during Threshing. Had Mealladh handle that; she watched him while they burned. So, every single first year in his squad." He bites the inside of his cheek and stands up, "And when we were younger..."


___

Since Brennan placed Dain on med-arrest again, he’s no longer allowed to leave the fortress grounds or wander far into the valley; yesterday after speaking with Cat he’d spent the late evening helping the House staff in the services sector—laundry, his favorite. When he’d tried to dilly-dally down the valley past the posts of hanging sheets, uniforms, and other fabrics he’d been herded away from the two Reds waiting at the bottom of the hill by the group of healers observing him.

*”This is why Dòrainn should not be permitted to shadow us.”*

*”He didn’t mean to Cath.”*

*”I’m sure you know not to playfully punch human children in the face, Knight.”*

Dain had sighs, *”That’s not fair. He sits in the hatching grounds playing around with hatchlings and adolescents all day, they probably get rough.”*

*”You are not a dragon hatchling.”*

He presses his palm right to middle of Cath’s snout, *”Oh? But you always call me hatchling.”*

Cath lifts his head as a few attendants are stepping through the reinforced doors at the top of the stairs; they meet in the morning after breakfast to speak face-to-face for a bit regardless of him being able to leave the grounds or not.

*”You are being difficult.”* He snaps, narrowing his eyes on Dain and dropping his head low so that to top of his snout is just about a meter above his rider,

*”Anyway—”* Dain scoffs when his hand drops from Cath’s scaled nose as the swordtail rises,

*”The fliers are all joining the forum, and some of the Generals.”*

Cath pauses, he thinks seriously for moment.

*”Careful what you mention."*

---

Over two-hundred fliers attend the Squadron’s forum.

They sit in groups mostly on one side of the theatre, while on the opposite side are Violet, Felix, Brennan, several dozen retired riders, and nearly all off-going watch standers and active duty riders.

Ulices Ferris, Duke Lindell, and Kylynn are also in attendance.

Dain suddenly feels odd standing before them in his civilian attire; sure, his garbs were all black and dyed much darker than fading black of some of the rider black uniforms he was seeing. He lacked any intimidation factor that their uniform granted and even his boots seemed comparatively luxurious to the standard issue ones. He wore a simple belt that hung low off his right hip with an alloy hilted dagger tucked into it's sheath.

“Have breakfast?” Abdullah asks Dain as he climbs the few steep steps to the stage,

Dain nods, “Yes.”

The rider's face is smooth and gives no trace of telling emotion; though his voice is laced with mild interest, his eyes are bored, "And coffee?"

"One cup." Dain admits, 

"Want another?"

A grin creeps onto his face, "Always."

He takes a steel tumbler about the size of a shortsword's hilt from Abdullah before watching Kingston answer a group of first year fliers' eager questions. He turns to Abdullah and speaks over the edge of the tumbler, the steam from the coffee warms his lips,

"I didn't think there were this many fliers." he admits; his sides pinch and breathing is rough for a moment while Abdullah talks,

*"The mender orders you to sit."*

Behind them, towards the center of the dais is a large table with just enough seating for Squadron. Dain sits, happily, and Abdullah follows him.

"They compensate in quantity what the dragons have in... everything else."

He lets his eyes fall shut, licking around the inside of his mouth at the smooth roast. This isn't Tyrrish, it's a Poromish brew; balanced, spiced, and robust. Adding sugar to this would ruin it.

Kingston introduce their Squadron; the two of them operate as a two-headed authority—Kingston with the weight of rank and seasoned control, and Dain with a mind like a blade held at the throat of tradition. Where Kingston embodied structure, Dain had become its calculated defiance—his strategies sharp, unorthodox, and drawn like spells no one else dared to cast. 

Still, they worked—in practice and theory, for now—so it seemed the Squadron had all the credibility they needed in him. But as Dain traces over the fliers fanned out across the theatre, watching him with unreadable faces, he wonders if that will hold once his tactics are tested by blood, not parchment, nor casual practice,

“Good morning.”

Kingston bows slightly then stands straight, lifting his stumbled chin and jaw high into the air and cutting through it equally as sharply with his voice projected by lesser magic.

The theatre is stone-walled and half-lit, built more for function than grandeur. Sound bounces sharply off the vaulted ceiling as Kingston’s heavily accented voice rises, and dust drifts lazily through the morning slats of light spearing in through narrow high windows. 

“For those of you who arrived in the last week observe the rhythm, then follow suit if you find yourself with question.”

He gestures to Abdullah, who speaks next, voice suggestively calmer, almost sleepy, “Dont feel uncomfortable in asking any questions regarding the riders and their dragons either. The idea is to have multiple Squadrons and some of you might be the ones recruited for them, so get yourself aquatinted.”

Kingston nods, then strides to the edge of the dais, the soft scuff of his boots amplified by the wood floor underfoot, “Name and where you’re from—stand to ask your question, and use the name and rank of who you’re addressing when you ask your questions.”

Dain doesn’t miss the way a few of the newer fliers straighten when Kingston moves—subtle, instinctual. Disciplined. There’s not space for anything besides strict formality within flier ranks, even in the inviting atmosphere they’ve curated.

“We’ll answer based on accuracy and confidentiality where we can.” Abdullah leans into the table as he speaks, voice like smoke curling through a crack in the wall—measured, unbothered. 

The silence stretches. Someone shifts in their seat, leather creaking. A cough breaks the stillness, soft but sharp enough to make three heads turn.

Dain watches for the hesitation in their bodies, the flicker of narrowed eyes or clenched jaws, but there’s none—only unreadable stillness. Squadron displays no show of discomfort at the silence choking the theatre, their faces remain stoic and determined.

*Except* for Blue, who wiggles her fingers across the surface of the table until someone takes her hand and her signet activates; she threads her fingers between Sven’s, a flier from Zoyla, and as her eyes open, his fade to a milky-white. 

It reminds him of Dòrainn.

She blinks, absorbs the sight of their audience, then slides her purple irises across her squadmates and smiling hugely when she spies Dain observing her—he smiles back.

“No question is a dumb one!” Daux chuckles, ltipping his chair or crossing his arms,

“Lieutenant Colonel Kingston,” A wiry brunette stands with quiet grace, two stark streaks of white hair framing her face like warpaint. She folds her hands neatly at her waist. “Samara Glasc, Cordyn.”

Kingston lifts his chin to her, blinks his golden-brown eyes, “Glasc.”

“Sir, you left your leadership position with the Nightwing Drift’s second most successful rider to bolster rider ranks—has it been worth it, and how is it helping Poromiel?”

Dain’s lip twitches; Glasc’s question is incredibly insightful, and Kingston must think the same by the way his face puzzles into a confident smirk,

“I left the Drift to test a theory—that rider and flier can do more than fly in tandem. They can think in tandem. Fight in tandem. Second Lieutenant Aetos proposed integration beyond formation, and I saw a chance to shift the sky in our favor. That is what I’ve chosen to fight for. That, Glasc, is how I serve Poromiel—by slaughtering more venin than I ever could have dreamed, on the backs of dragons and riders who share one truth: we are not lesser in the eyes of our enemy.”

He points and Glasc, then himself. A few heads tilt. One flier crosses her arms; another shifts in his seat. They’re listening, now—really listening. As she lowers back into her seat another stands—this time a taller boy with close-cropped hair like Kai had when he’d first arrived at Basgiath.

“Lieutenant Colonel Kingston; Titan Belle, Van Price—Cygnisen.”

Belle breathes before he asks his question, he looks down at the two who bracket him at his seat and then straightens up to attention before Kingston’s piercing stare.

“This is gonna be a big one…” Lucian mutters to Dain, he’s crooked across his seat, curled in towards Dain though his body faces the Cadets,

“Do you feel… less capable than the riders? They can throw fire, *command* lightning, summon water. Do you feel your weight in combat matters as much as theirs?”

Kingston shifts his weight in thought, and lifts a hand to caress his jaw.

“I’m going to pass this off to the man who sees me as powerful as wielders who are gifted with such intimidating signets—“ he gestures to Dain,

“Do you mind, Second Lieutenant?”

Dain shakes his head, “Not at all.”

He rises to his feet slowly and cranes his neck upwards where Titan Belle stands red faced at the center of the theatre. The cadets around him whisper wildly; Dain begins to speak after Kingston taps his foot, *once* and the room is engulfed in silence again.

“The idea of combat is contorted. We like to think the amount of potential *destruction* equates the direct level of success a unit, military, or nation has in battle. Some cases, maybe even most, that might be correct. But if that’s your only measure, you’ve overlooked tactic.”

Dain clears his throat and lets his weight drop across the side of Lucian that hangs off his chair—he mirrors the movement, effectively turning himself into a crutch with blinding smile,

“We may end up engaging in these battles at cities, places full of life, and I want to preserve that. If I take a riot of dragons whose riders only know mindless destruction, I’m no better than them.”

He stands straighter and Lucian scoots closer, glancing up at him with worried eyes; Gale, another one of their fliers, chuckles at the worried look on Lucian’s face.

“Belle, when I come for them, I dont want them know I’m there, or coming. I want them to wonder—to sit and wallow in the eventualities that might become of them. Gryphons’ gifts are *priceless*. Used right, they can take a rider out from the inside—make their dragon useless in a heartbeat. No signet is greater than a gift in the right setting, backed by proper training.”

Before Dain sits he pauses.

“There’s hierarchy and planning within their ranks like ours—treating venin like simple-minded monsters and approaching them like simple-minded riders and fliers is a magnificent waste of time in the grand scheme of what could be accomplished. I want them *eradicated,* not just dead. Six hundred years ago it wasn’t done well enough, so this time it will be.”

“Sir—Second Lieutenant Aetos—“

Another tall fliers tears away from his seat, already at attention and announcing himself before Belle can even digest what Dain as said,

“Stay sitting, you’re teetering while you stand. You aren’t healed up well.” Lucian bites, grabbing his thigh.

“Sir; Flynn Fitz, Miele. It *was* a village east of Suniva,” Fitz stammers, then takes a deep breath, “Do you think we’ll ever find a way to identify venin amongst ourselves? I know Navarre as been infiltrated more than once and it concerns me—in Poromiel it’s few and far in between that venin manage to hide amongst out ranks.”

Abdullah takes the question.

“We have our theories and hypotheticals, but nothing we come up with can be tested until we hit the field.”

He avoids it.

Dain stews over it.

Poromiel is being pushed to the brink but not from the inside? He finds it odd—Navarre maintained fully functional wards for quite a bit of time and had venin beyond them on multiple occasions, whilst since Aretia’s reinstatement of theirs, there have been none.

Does he chalk it up to the population density with Basgiath? There’s the possibility that erecting a Tyrrish schoolhouse might just be another entry point for the venin-aligned at Basgiath to further infiltrate the the Kingdom at the influx of cadets. No—Dain lets his eyes roam and finds himself watching Glasc as her own brown eyes roam across the table they're seated at—he knew there were venin aligned professors at Basgiath.

He just wasn't able to truly determine *who,* or *why.*

And even after that; what was the reason.

Is the weapon mentioned six-hundred years ago that venin were looking for, the one that drove them back to the barrens, was it *in* Navarre? Basgiath?

They thwarted Melgren to attack the college, but for *what?*

They flew over Cordyn to attack Draithus, for *who?*

Raury’s clamoring voice shatters the silence, "The same way they utilize runes in their wyvern, lures, poisons, and since Draithus their nets, we have begun developing our own aces." 

"We've begun the process of creating our own aces, we just need to test them." Kingston's drawl slides against Dain's train of thought, 

Fitz relaxes, "That's the intention when you guys leave for the expedition right?"

"Right."

"Captain Radomirka; Gile Banks, Cordyn."

Banks is shorter than the two other men who spoke before him. His eyes sit high above his cheekbones and flick sharply upwards, he stands rigidly, not at attention but he maintains a demeanor that presents him as respectful nonetheless. 

Radomirka's head bobs up from a field report she reads, her hair is long, woven into thick braids that fall past her waist where she sits. When she stands to acknowledge the cadet her hands snake into her pockets,

"Speak."

"How are you feeling about the flight structures when sharing airspace with riders?"

Radomirka smirks. Dain swallows when her muscled arm swings and a ringer index finger points accusingly at him,

"That guy is a psychopath. *That* is our upper hand. Navarre picked the single most unhinged pair to train us in tandem units."

She saunters away from the table, taps it twice with her knuckle in fleeting thought before speaking up again, "He hides us in dragon-flanks, flings us across hundreds of meters and stories worth of open space to change tactics at the drop of feather. Have you ever flown upside down—I have."

Banks face goes pale, "U-Upside down?"

"Aetos understands as well as we do, thanks to the fliers of course," she swings her round face to his and flashes a snaggle-toothed smile, "that venin's edge is their ability to constantly adapt to our own fighting styles. Second Lieutenant lets his *dragon* command the skies he flies in, and Cath is a Malek reincarnate. Our paradigms shift faster than sea tides and scattering light."

Cath preens.

"So I'm assuming that... Cath get's along with the gryphons?" Banks suggests with a puzzled look,

"Yeah sure, he talks to the gryphons well enough. Ours are fond of Aetos, so his dragon reciprocates the treatment."

"Doesn't he scare you?"

"Of course he does. he's like a fifty foot moving obelisk that would rather use me as tinder than a teammate." Radomirka steps between Don, another flier who worked with Kingston in the Nightwing Drifts, and the Lieutenant Colonel.

The forum lasts a whopping four hours.

The questions range from far opposite sides of the spectrum—serious and unheard of as learning to weave wards to protect Poromish cities, to what a dragon's scales feel like.

Dain can't help but lock eyes with Violet for most of it, and she approaches him as the fliers file out, she crosses her arms,

"You zoned out half way, what's wrong?"

When he meets her eyes they're nearly entirely hazel, green blurred into a bright amber-brown as she observes him.

"We need to talk."

Because she knows something he doesn't.
