 
"Are you okay? You look... pale."

Maiselle's been watching him closely as his eyes flicker through the squads and sections of Fourth Wing. He's counted, once, twice, three times—Sloane Mairi isn't where she should be. She isn't squished between Avalynn and Lynx, not hidden behind Baylor, and Imogen's shadow isn't a fiery blonde. Cat, Maren, and Kai stand awkwardly behind Sawyer, peaking around him at the collection of dragons perched on the masonry. Violet watches wide-eyed as they argue amongst themselves, her weight shifts from left—where Ridoc watches with his mouth fixed open—to right, brushing against Rhi's thigh.

"Are you going to speak or should I?" Maiselle hisses under her breath, he can barely hear her over the roaring and bellowing of the dragons,

"I don't give a fuck, Maiselle, just get it done." he barks, walking to edge of dais.

Violet's eyes lock with his and he can feel her 'what's wrong?' as he pans over them _again_.

She's not there.

She's not _here._

Cath, between the formations and Dain, leans his head down close to Dain, swinging in so quickly the other wingleaders jump and scurry to the opposite side, _"You must focus."_

_"I can't—she isn't here. I can't find Sloane. I don't see Thoirt."_

Cath perks at the mention of Thoirt and swivels his neck impossibly backwards without moving his body; he scans over the cadets, then his kind. It's chaos; Drue screaming at Maiselle as the Quadrant receives the memories of witnessed Codex infractions: planting paraphernalia and conducting unauthorized searches for blackmail, attacking marked ones in their sleep, squad challenges—it's all messy, pointlessly driven by pride. The six Navarrian riders, to include their wingleader seem to think arguing on behalf of Navarre and a conspiracy, the unforeseen coup, will save them from their shortsighted actions. First Wing crowds around their peers, shouting, _screaming_. He watches as the surviving marked ones are found in the crowd, pulled towards the dais. 

_"Thoirt is fine."_

Dain's nerves sour; Cath is purposely withholding information from him. His Red wouldn't outright lie to him, they'd been over that, but the handfeeding crumbs worth of detail was real and crushing him at the moment.

_"What about Sloane?"_ he begs, pleading through the bond,

Cath twists his neck and blinks at Dain, his powerful voice shakes in his mind, _"I assume your Favored is as well."_

"The consequences of your actions are not a result of Codex infractions, First Wing!" He hears Maiselle shriek; Drue is in her face, matching her tone when Dain whips around. His patience has sanded down to nothing and he grabs Drue by the collar,

"You killed _six_ bonded riders!" His voice heats in the coals of his frustration and her mousey face puckers at the sight of him, "Six signets gone because what? We're at war Drue, challenges ending in death are no longer acceptable! Why would you think that is?!"

Cath bellows ahead of him, effectively quieting the area all the same and from the corner of his eye he catches Violet's dragons suspended over them.

"We can't afford losses on account of each other," Dain amends, "On account of _personal_ views and conspiracies."

Drue's face twists into bleak desperation, "Marked ones planning a coupe is _not_ a conspiracy. It's an eventuality."

"Prove it." he speaks to her but his eyes scan the perimeter, boggled and wild because Sloane is still not where she should be, and he levels his dead glare on her, "_Now_."

She squints, his voice peaks in her face, singing harshly against her eardrums but Iris Drue has no testimony. Nothing to unseal her fate.

"What happens to you today isn't according to proper procedure—you answer to the _Empyrean_ for you falter." Lesser magic coaxes his voice over the Quadrant and he pushes Drue off the edge of the dais.

Dain blanches, _"Can you as Thoirt?"_ he yells at Cath, he doesn't mean to, but it doesn't matter. The panic is setting in rougher than it had after he'd seen Violet and what Varrish had done to her. He can only see Sloane's body, strained and slumped across the sparring mat, he can feel how cold she was, and how dry her blueish lips felt as he resuscitated her,

_"Cath—"_

Iris Drue's Orange clubtail's jowls unlock as it drops down from the sky snout first, they stretch wide and position her perfectly between teeth and tongue, they snap shut and sound of bone breaking like toothpicks between fingers echoes through the field—someone screams, followed by most, if not the rest of the Quadrant. He's _just_ shoved her off the dais, she hadn't even hit the floor yet. The Orange's golden eyes fix on him, reflecting complete calm and resolution, before twisting and launching back into the clouds so quickly there's only the sharp whistle of air as it breaks across it's body.

Dain freezes.

The sight repeats itself; the five other accused riders from First Wing disappear in the mouths of their _bonds_. Cold sweat permeates on his skin and his stomach churns violently, he staggers forward. Ahead of him he watches Rhiannon herd Fourth Wing closer to the rotunda as dragons land and flee, heating the sky with flame, Cath extends himself ahead of Dain's Wing, separating them all from the anarchy unfolding; First, Second, and Third spread thin over the field, some crying, retching, running anywhere a dragon isn't, but they're surrounded.

Dragons are perched like birds on the masonry, _watching._

Fear swells in his heart but Cath is faster than his emotions; he floods their pathways in the wasteland with reassurance and calm, he slowly blinks down at Dain from ahead of the dais. His magic infects him, swelling at his navel before poisoning the rest of him. The feeling of sickness wracks behind his eyes and Dain covers his face with his hands, he's soaked in sweat, delirious with worry, but the fear of the dragons around him dissipates with Cath's steady watch over him. Through it all, Sloane still ravages his thoughts. 

Had they gotten her right before their moments of judgement?

He can't leave without reporting to leadership, but what if he left? _What if he just left?_

Dain breaks away from the Dais, dropping down and landing effortlessly with a heavy thud, he strides underneath Cath's belly to Rhiannon,

"Where is Mairi?" he pants,

"She has archive duty, I told her she could just go there and stay there—" she grimaces, "and now I'm happy I did. Are you okay?"

He inhales deeply, "No."

---

She's organizing recently published tombs in their respective places when he finally gets his eyes on her, she's _humming_. Sloane's encapsulated in the protection of parchment, glue, and bindings. He'd run through the college as fast as his feet would take him and by the time he arrived to the archives he was so drenched and disheveled the scribe standing watch outside of them just waved him through dismissively.

"Sloane." he drawls,

She hops up a bit, surprised, and spins around, "Aetos? What's wrong with you? Why are you sweating like that?"

She's here. Safe, content. Her hair is brushed up into a tight braided ponytail that swings behind her like a rope; Dain crowds her against the shelf she's working on and grabs her hands.

"Why are you here?" she hisses, dropping the tomb she was preparing to slide into place; his clammy hands crush over hers and she winces,

_"You."_ he croaks, dropping his forehead on her shoulder, "I couldn't fucking see you—," he presses her against the shelf and some of the tombs fall through the opposite side, "I couldn't find you Sloane, I—"

Sloane grabs his face and drags it ahead of hers, "During the quorum?"

He nods and drops his hands from her wrists,

"Rhi told me it was going to be a mess and gave me permission to muster in the morning with her before formation, that Jessinia needed me to prepare a collection for Violet because she was called away for something. She said I was fine to miss it."

He blinks sweat away from his eyes, "Why didn't you tell me?"

Sloane looks confused, "Why would I? I figured the information would work its way up the chain of command, and Violet's more important than the quo—,"

"Not more important than _you_." he gasps, _"I couldn't find you."_

Her eyes soften for him, those lakes navy blue in the dark ambience of the archives, calm with not a single cresting wave, "Breathe."

He collapses to his knees and she slides downwards with him, guiding him to the floor. His mind settles mildly and embarrassment races through his body, instantaneously his ears and neck turn pink. Dain focuses on his breathing and Sloane times hers with his and lifts his face again, rubbing her thumbs against his beard and blowing soft puffs of breaths against his face.

"I didn't mean to make you worry." she whispers against his jaw,

He avoids her eyes, instead flicking his gaze to anywhere else on her face, he means to reassure her but his voice is caught somewhere deep inside of him. All he can do is struggle to breathe. He snakes a hand up to one of hers against his face, nuzzling into it. A shaking exhale racks his body and Sloane scowls, "Are you sure you're okay?"

Their faces are only about two inches apart, maybe less.

Did she realize how close he was to her? That she was pushed up against a bookshelf in a dark, abandoned corner of the archives and hidden behind a rickety cart?

Her hands gliding through his hair against his scalp shock his attention back to her ahead of him, back to her perpetually pouted lips and her perfectly straight teeth peaking out from behind them. He tries to think of something to say and prepares to paraphrase how the quorum went when Sloane drops her forehead against his and closes her eyes.

Cath sends silk emotions against the wasteland; reassurance. It drowns the bond while Dain replays the image of dragons snatching their bonds from the field, erasing their existence in split seconds. He thought bond-breaking would be more poetic and emotionally unsettling, but this felt like a warning. Ominous fearmongering and a taste of what was intended. Cath's coddling drowns the magic down with his nerves as he accepts his emotions into him, Dain let's it erase the symptoms almost entirely.

"I'm safe. You're safe."

Her voice chimes around him like Loial's temple bells. The treble of it ringing tranquility in him and he finally manages to calm down. Her crystalline eyes open slowly and settle on his. He can't help noticing the flush that raises to her cheeks and across her nose—like someone took strawberries and smeared them across her face.

"Dain?" 

It's the first time she's said his name.

Quietly, gently, shyly, pressed up against him in the archives.

"Sloane," his voice leaves him huskily, low and questioning, perceptibly inviting.

Reality mixes with his thoughts and he embraces the delusion that she leans in as he does, capturing his lips with feeble curiosity. She's so _strong_, and she feels natural against him. He slants his head to kiss her more deeply and she welcomes him in, craning her neck back against the shelf and sliding her arms over his shoulders and digging her fingers between them as his body presses into hers. Sloane's breathing becomes labored when he slides his tongue into her mouth, sucking on hers when she timidly mimics the motion; she tastes like she had fruit this morning, he licks away the hints of it—wishes he could've been the fruit she'd bitten into. Their teeth scrape and he bites her lower lip hard, shoving his tongue back in her mouth when she gasps and shoves her breasts up against his chest.

_"Sloane."_ he rasps while pulling for the briefest breath, sucking in a sharp breath and kissing her again, his arms bracketing the sides of her body to hold himself up. She moans into his mouth and the tilting choke of a cleared throat rips the two of them apart. They freeze, locked in place like statues, hearts pounding in sync. Sloane captures her lips between her teeth and her eyes stay at his until he finally launches up to his feet; he can _feel_ the embarrassment on his face and turns his head to the side at Jessinia. She watches them with raised brows from the center aisle. 

_"Good morning,"_ he signs, stupidly.

_"Good morning,"_ she returns, _"I'm guessing you're here for Violet's satchel?_"

Jessinia innocently glancing down at Sloane who simply covers her face and tucks her head into her bent knees, then back to him.

_"Right."_ he signs.

For fucking Violet.

---

_“Perfect. Let us formally add this to your growing list of proclivities.”_ Cath snarls.

He's fresh from the bathing chamber, mid-tug, and naked across the length of his bed when his dragon creeps into his mind.

The remembrance of Sloane's lips is curtained by red scales and Dain growls in frustration.

_"Maybe don't actively be here for it every time then?"_ he snaps sarcastically.

Cath takes the hint, mostly.

He twists himself, rubbing slowly with his other hand splayed against the lower half of his pelvis.

She was so perfect against him—supple, willing, and _moaning_. Her cheeks had adopted a perfectly complementary shade of pink that dusted her face like pollen and when he pulled away from her that first time she tightened her arms around his shoulders as if she didn't want him to go.

She wanted _more_ of him.

He swipes across his tip and shudders against the sheets, curling his toes.

What would her tongue feel like against him, twisting around his cock instead of his tongue? What would she feel like _on_ him? They'd known each for close to a year now, he wanted to skip the friendship and jump straight into something official with her.

He wanted all of her.

Pleasure builds in his lower back like molten sand, slowly spreading into the rest of his limbs while he teases himself. He burrows his head into his pillow and strokes faster, shaking as stars blink behind his eyes and recalls the scent of Sloane.

Grass and lemons and wildflowers—f_uck._

The knocking on his door makes him jerk out of his fantasy and he releases a guttural snarl before pulling on a fresh pair of uniform trousers. He stands with his head against the door as he comes down, softening against the leather, then pulls the handle down and opens it enough to glare down—

"Dain?" Sloane chirps, "Feeling better?"

She's unbraided her ponytail and it now whips energetically behind her when she lifts her head up to smile at him. Her sparring uniform hugs her tight body and she laces her finger together at her thighs.

His heart inflates, "I am. I must've shocked you," he licks his lips and opens the door wider, "sorry."

"Don't be sorry." she mumbles, her face pinkish, _"I'm not."_

Avalynn leans in from her right, "Uh, Aetos? There's another dragon here for you."

He cuts his eyes down at Avalynn, "Another dragon?"

Wasn't her hair red? 

"Yeah, he's like... fighting with Cath?"

His neck snaps up, _"Cath?"_

_"You will stay there."_ his Red snipes, _"Do not come here!"_

Avalynn whispers something to Sloane and she burns crimson up to her nose, both blondes stare at him.

_"Why?"_

_"Don't you dare argue with me, Hatchling!"_

Dain lets a frustrated exhale tear through his grit teeth, _"Tell me who it is and I'll listen. You purposely ignored me when I asked about Sloane earlier."_

He's always so damn difficult, Dain seethes. Cath never shedding anything besides what's on the surface hadn't changed for years. Getting simple information from him was akin to pulling teeth at times.

Cath snarls, _"You do not bargain with dragons, Knight."_

Dain grabs Avalynn and Sloane's forearms to pull them into his room, _"You're more than a dragon to me Cath—tell me."_

He turns away from them, staring at his towel on his bed where a perfectly good orgasm had been cruelly ruined. Who would be here to see him? As a dragon no less? He wonders if it's the messenger from the Empyrean, though that dragon was meant to report to Codagh.

"Cath. You stingy, old man." he curses, gently kicking the bed with his bare foot,

Avalynn gasps behind him and grabs Sloane, "My dragon would literally light me on fire if I said that to him."

_"Dòrainn."_

He throws his hands up in disbelief, "You could've just said that! Same thing during the quorum!"

"They're closer than most." Sloane offers Avalynn simple explanation with a disinterest shrug,

_"You need to focus on your duties!"_

"I can multitask!"

_"Like you did during the quorum?!"_ Cath spits.

"That would have gone much differently if you had just imparted the information I needed." Dain retorts, pacing the length of the room,

_"You needed to focus."_ Cath hisses determinedly, _"What will you do now that you know he is here?"_

"Does he always talk out loud to him?" Avalynn gossips with her head tilted to the side,

Dain stops pacing, "I don't know. What does he want?"

Sloane's powder blue eyes slide up to the ceiling then back on him, "I hope he only does this behind closed doors..."

Avalynn laughs harder.

_"To see you."_ worry flits up his spine from the bond.

_"Do you not want me to?"_ when Cath doesn't answer he rubs his eyes with the back of his palms, _"If you tell me you don't want me around him I'll avoid it... But he's the only lead I have on my mom since you won't tell me anything."_

The swordtail emits a tortured roar that ricochets painfully in his head.

_That's_ new, Dain thinks.

He turns to Sloane, "Battle Brief."

"We should go now," she says,

Avalynn nods, "Last class finally."

He turns to the armoire and regrets not pulling on briefs before his leathers.

"So what does the other dragon want?" Avalynn pokes,

Dain dons the rest of his uniform, then his socks and sits on the edge of his bed to slide his feet into his boots, "He's..."

"Is it Dòrainn?" Sloane asks, she's standing by the door rubbing her thumb against its handle.

"Yeah. Did Thoirt tell you?" They make eye contact and glance in opposite directions,

"No," she scrunches her nose, "Just a hunch?"

He chuckles, "Good hunch."

Sloane and Avalynn take double his steps as they follow him to Battle Brief, the three of them file in last. There's no seats left and he scans for an uncrowded portion of the back wall to stand against,

"Wingleader Aetos," Professor Devera calls while he stands to her right looking for a place,

"Yes?"

"There's... an unbonded, Red _morningstartail_ requesting your presence." she pauses, "You're excused until further notice if you need it."

Every possible pair of eyes collapse over him, soaking him in invasive curiosity.

_"Tonight."_ Cath grumbles.

"Thank you," he nods, "I'm aware."

He begins up the rows of full seats to a mostly bare area by a group of fliers,

"You aren't going?" she says in mild disbelief,

"...not now." he answers, "He's with Cath; they're... friends."

_"He is not my friend."_ Cath bites.

"He's _not_ Cath's friend." Dain corrects, rolling his eyes.

The cadets watching look at him like _he's_ the dragon.

Sloane raises a brow at him as she passes by him.

"Right. Then—,"

Their lecture begins and Sloane moves to let Dain shuffle in behind her, since he's taller, and presses herself directly against his front, peaking back over her shoulder at him as the fliers fill in the spaces around them.

"Tell me why Dòrainn's here," she demands, hushed and swiftly,

"Not right now. Class." he whispers to her, pushing her forwards at her shoulders.

Her face smooths into a grin that promises mischief and mild suffering and Dain goes ashen.

She presses harder, and his waist shoves against her lower back before dropping her head back to look up at him, eyes twinkling with mischief. His mind boggles stupidly, he's one of the tallest against the whole damn wall and he does his best to turn his chin down subtly and narrows his eyes on Sloane. She gestures for him to lean further and he does. He dips his ear down to her lips at the side of her face.

Who the fuck would tell her no?

"Are you feeling better, Dain?" her voice is warm satin against his skin, and his name in her voice's tenor is pure hell for him. He adores hearing it and never imagined the headrush he'd experience at something so damn simple.

"I'd be even better if you—" he presses into the wall when she shifts her weight against him, rolling her hips, "stop doing that."

She nips his ear, bouncing up to her toes to sink her teeth into the soft cartilage, "Stop what?"

A hum bleeds out of him—somewhere between a moan and a sigh.  

He coughs _loudly_, rough and desperate, hoping it smothers the sound.  

The fliers turn to stare.  

Sloane, already a step ahead, slides forward like nothing happened and he instinctively grabs her side, fisting her waistband and the bottom of her uniform top at once and pulling to make her stay. Sloane's head gently collides with Avalynn's as she careens downwards into her, and she erupts into feminine outburst of giggles. It must be contagious, because Avalynn does it right back and they both cover their mouths as if it'll help anything. 

Dain slaps his hand into his face and presses his thumb and index finger into his eyes.

"Aetos?" Professor Devera remarks, and it summons the rest of the room's attention.

"Sorry," is all he manages with the raise of his free hand, "Sorry."

Violet swivels in her seat both brows raised, and Cat a few behind her with a nearly identical expression, before the rest of Iron Squad follows suit, and then the rest of the quadrant.

He _knows_ his face is red as his swordtail and they can all see it.

_"You’re embarrassing yourself."_

_“Shut up, Cath.”_
