The seconds pass by like months into years and those years just single days within centuries.

Cath had told Dain tonight—but the yearning to _understand_, more than to know, what lies within the void his mother had left behind in generating his existence eats at him like a wildfire; it burns, and takes, and hurts. In it's wake he's left a shell of what he'd been just hours ago with Sloane.

The moonlight bathes Cath's scales with indigo hues and shifts as his torso rises and falls. The two of them had fallen asleep atop a mountain nearby the flight field, one used often for flight maneuvers, and Cath was a never ending expanse of garnet protecting him from the winds whipping across the mountain peak. Ridges in the distance cut the stars in crooked lines, like old scars across the sky, and they both watch moonlight bleed from the edges.

They hadn't said a word to each other since his last class.

He had pressed himself up against Cath's side and closed his eyes while his dragon's emotions filtered through the sand so their wasteland. There were many. Fear for what Dòrainn might ask him to reveal to his bond, anger for what he could not—what he _would_ _not_ in the name of protecting Dain—and the helplessness in consenting to the conversation that hadn't happened yet.

Dain wasn’t sure if the guilt in his chest was his or Cath’s. It didn’t matter. They shared it now and Dain finds himself chasing after Cath's insecurities with blind reassurance. They were infinitely close—and yet, Dain strains mentally—and yet they were so far apart. Cath took up all the space in the world around him, but none of it filled what was carved out before he was born.

Like now, atop the mountain peak; his back pressed against scales that in just two or three in number equate the size of him, they were still so far apart. No matter how tightly Cath fit himself around Dain he was simply too large and there would always be enough space to fit Adarna in the space where his body couldn't squeeze any tighter.

_"I know I'm being selfish."_

There's a pause, wind breaks across Cath's body and passes overhead of Dain, barely ruffling his hair,

_"Most hatchlings are."_

Cath's voice calms something in him, he sinks into the sensation, regulating his emotions through conversation.

_"I'm sorry."_

His Red shifts, flicks his tail ahead of Dain, _"Why must you be sorry?"_

_"Because,"_ he breathes in deep, closes his eyes again and drops his head against Cath, "_I'm forcing you to be brave for me, to face things you don't need to."_

_"You are brave. You have always been."_ Cath bellows.

His posture reads as if he were sleeping, but Dain realizes he might've only dozed off for a moment: Cath had been awake, sitting in these heated emotions,

_"Only because I have you, Cath."_

Cath chortles and fills the chilled air with his alien rumble and the bond with sparking content that forced a grin to break across his face unintentionally—_love_—but immediately shadowing it—_fear_.

He didn’t ask if Dain was afraid. Maybe he already knew. Maybe he was, too.

_"Dòrainn arrives."_

Dain stands and steps between the tip of Cath's swordtail and his snout, enough that one of his golden eyes could peer down at him.

_"Are you sure?"_

Cath's eyes slide shut, _"I am not."_

They're both afraid.

Dòrainn lands at a peak well past them, he navigates through them with ease, knocking down entire trees in his wake; the path his body recklessly clears is black mirth in the distance until his horns are visible just atop the tree line. He stayed close to Cath a moment longer, just long enough to pretend none of it was about to change, before stepping into the clearing and equidistant between the two dragons.

The wind beats him relentlessly as he escapes into the night, abandoning the shelter and warmth of Cath's body—Dòrainn watches him shiver and slide on his riding gloves. The observation is mutual between the two, but the quiet dread is shared between the three of them. Dain bows, like usual and in proper approach, before allowing himself the confidence to meet Dòrainn's milky eye—to peer into the gouged hole where another used to be, where the scales healed against each other like festered blister.

_"He wishes you shared more of your mother's appearance."_ Cath states; he was still, but somehow completely frozen now,

Dain laughs, "Me too." he admits aloud.

He doesn't even know what she looks like in reality so his laughter is shallow and hangs awkwardly between them and the silence that follows stretches for a beat too long. Dain glances behind himself at side of Cath's head that he can see.

He feels it in the bond that they're speaking amongst themselves, even more when Cath's agitations explodes in the wasteland as he speaks,

_"He inquires, if you have been to the Empyrean yet."_

Cath was furious—not at him, but the question—but still, Dain burned with it.

Dain's confusion is evident on his face and he turns back to Dòrainn,

"Why would I—"

Their face snap upwards as a black mass descends into the clearing at the left of Dòrainn and Cath, Dain covers his face as rubble and foliage beat up from the forest floor and across his face. The ground trembles, bends even, as the other dragon lands. He thinks Tairn, but it's not, and as the wind and trees settle he recognizes wings tattered nearly as badly as Dòrainn's:

_It's Codagh._

But why?

Dain watches Cath and Dòrainn; they seem unimpressed, not that they should be, mostly annoyed—especially Dòrainn when Codagh fixes his ancient glare on Dain. His presence is overwhelming and ominous. As if tension and anxiety hadn't peaked already, Codagh has now tipped the scale so far that Dain's heart beats irregularly. 

He turns his body to Cath, steps back towards him on instinct then flees entirely.

Once he's underneath his lowered chin he glances at Dòrainn again, who's milky eye is narrowed so thinly it seems like a silver scar across his beaten face. Dain stands rigid, jaw tight, his breath visible in the cold and again, the seconds pass painfully.

Dòrainn approaches slowly, gaze lowered—not out of submission, but reverence for the weight of what he’s about to say as he peeks at Dain beneath Cath.

_"You want your truths, and you should. But you must understand... they never began with you.”_

Cath speaks slowly, and concisely for Dòrainn; he doesn't plan on repeating himself, so Dain hyper fixates on his thunderous voice, hearing every syllable and chasing the words they form,

“Where does it begin?” Dain asks, barely above a whisper.

_“With the Empyrean. With your parents. With how magic was shaped, and how your parents defied it. Speak with your father. You are not the first anomaly. Only the one that lived.”_

Dain scoffs, ignoring the mention of the General, “Anomaly?”

Dòrainn fixes his eyes on him, steady and profound. 

_“There are things I cannot say unless you are willing to carry the burden. Because knowing them could get us all pointlessly killed and if Codagh speaks in riddles, it’s because oblivion has kept you alive this long.”_

“What’s that supposed to mean?”

_“It means the Empyrean forgets what it fears. And it fears what it cannot define. You’ve been tolerated, not protected.”_

Dain’s voice breaks, “So I’m abnormal... but not important enough to understand why?”

Dòrainn lowers his body to the grassy floor in a mirror of Cath's posture; their horns nearly touch and above them Codagh peers down at him with indifferent suspicion. He's packed between the Reds, fitted between where the wind can't reach him, shielding him in house-height walls of living, scaled flesh,

_“You were never unimportant, Dain. You were just too important, to us, to risk knowing what you are—"_

A pause.

_"—and if you knew the reason you were conceived... maybe you wouldn’t want to live with it."_

He descends down, _down down down,_ somewhere where the bond can't reach him, far underneath Cath's chin and against his chest where none of them can see him, where he's safe from Codagh's evaluative leer and the elements all together. His breathing quickens.

Just how badly can terms and conditions be—he begins to think but then he remembers seeing the truth once before, while breathing in the coppery scent of Violet's blood. The Empyrean and Navarre had hid centuries of truth, embroidered him into fabricated realities, groomed him into someone he wasn't.

And he was once so certain and proud—what a fucking fool he was.

He remembered being told once, that he needed to think carefully about each choice he made—but did people make _choices_? Was he ever at any point choosing for himself? He woke up and laced his boots, certainly chose to walk left or right down hallways, but Dain hadn't built those structures that confined him.

They were erected long before him, by _someone else._

No path he'd taken was ever truly his own.

Cath's voice interrupts him, gently, kindly, _paternally_, and he lets his swordtail pull him back to the night sky, wills himself to be rescued from his mental hell, he's sweating, shivering—

_"But you have always been loved, Knight."_

—he steadies to his feet.

_"I'd like to go back."_ he stammers into the bond, _"__I want to go back."_

---

_"Approach this the way that is comfortable for you."_

Cath tells him as he scales his neck to dismount; he lowers his neck level with the grassy earth and Dain hops down, watching as his neck rises to it's full height and eclipses the moon,

_"And you?"_ Dain worries, _"Do I compromise you in wanting to understand me?"_

He can make out the glint of Cath's eyes against the moonlight, and his dragon slides them shut, before crouching and fleeing into night.

_"I will do anything for you."_ he declares.

Dain's shoulders sag and his head drops as Cath's shields rise slowly before locking place; he was meant to make these decisions for himself and not with Cath,

_"Wait—"_

"I don't want to think about this by myself."

His words mean nothing as they pass his lips and into thin air behind Cath's shrinking form, falling only on his own ears and forcing him to hear just how broken he was. He realizes the sound of Cath leaving had never been loud—but the silence after was, and he didn't want to be alone _at all_. Not in his mind, and not here in Basgiath.

Never before had the deafening beating of wings been so comforting and tragic for him.

Dain turns away from the courtyard dais and begins the trek to the rotunda.

His breathing quickens into a pant as he walks.

Then into something sharper.

Shallower.

Each step across the courtyard is louder than the last—his boots against the grass, breath stuck against his ribs, thoughts screaming in every corner of his mind. The chill of the night isn't bracing anymore. It _claws_. His fingers twitch at his sides, curling into fists, then releasing. Again. Again. _Again._

The rotunda is only a few paces away.

His throat tightens. A burn starts behind his eyes and spreads. The world narrows around the sound of his own breath. No. Not breath—his _gasps_. His chest compresses under invisible weight, and suddenly he can’t pull in enough air to fill his lungs. The open space around him feels too big, the sky too wide, and his mind too loud.

He tries to run.

It turns into a stagger. Then a sprint that barely holds together.

Dain makes it to the rotunda just as his knees threaten to buckle, shoving through the archway like the night itself might swallow him whole if he slows down.

He collapses into the cool marble interior with a gasped sob, one hand catching the column nearest the entryway. His other clamps over his mouth as his body retches dryly, air refusing to cooperate with instinct. He’s heaving, gasping into a straw full of vicious fluid.

A hand reaches his nape and it's warm and he almost leans into it, but as Dain realizes he's not alone he spins around, drawing his shortsword and assuming an offensive stance.

But it's not his father.

It's Sloane, cozy in a soft set of nightwear he'd seen before—_Liam's_—rolled up to compensate her infinitely smaller build and her flight jacket; her glaive is strapped to her back by a thick leather strap, and it taps against her shoulder as she cautiously advances towards him along the blade, completely unphased.

"I was waiting for you to get back." she whispers, then, "You need to breathe."

He tosses the sword, dropping it roughly to his left, "I _can't_."

They repeat their moment in the archives, folding to the floor in the middle of the rotunda slowly; Sloane rubs her thumbs across his stubbled jaw, and blows wisps of her own breath at his face in controlled repetitions.

"My signet, your brother," he blathers as his concerns jumble together like vines, "_Liam_—don't touch me."

She shakes her head, "You weren't worried about that before, Dain. And If you don't breathe I'll kiss you,"

The idea pierces through all of his other concerns; he lowers his gaze to her pouted flesh, damp, wetted by her pink tongue that flicks out shyly between them, and he blinks rapidly at her little puffs, "That won't help—"

But it _does_.

Her lips are full, pillowy, a warm caress against his clamored skin that anchors him to her, and she breaks away for a moment after his tremors calm, 

"Looks like it helped."

"One more," he wheezes, dazed and grabbing her hands on his jaws with his own,

Sloane slides them over his shoulders, then her arms, until her biceps rest against them, kissing him so slowly his eyes roll. The fervor that had consumed them in the archives was gone—replaced with worry and concern. She didn't close her eyes and neither did he. She watched as she sank into him, chasing away each shorted breath with her wet mouth, _ruining_ him.

"Once more," Dain pleads when she pulls away to analyze his disposition again.

Sloane slants her mouth over his as his mind fills with just _her_ and when her eyes slide shut his do too. She smells freshly showered, and the clean, linen aroma of her bodywash nearly masks her grassy, floral scent that wafts from between them. Finally he manages his breaths through his nose as his mouth occupies itself with hers and she breaks the kiss, panting this time instead,

"Sloane," he rasps desperately, encircling his arms low on her waist, _"Again."_

It's never just one, but there's always more.

Dain can't think of anything else because he doesn't want to, so he guesses it does help; he indulges himself fully.

Sloane lets him, and right now, that’s enough.

---

Sawyer's asleep outside of his door when he arrives back in the dorms.

His mouth parted slightly, his shoulders rise and fall with each breath and his head rolls softly off Violet's own; who sleeps with her neck bent downwards, hanging over Rhi's peaceful face in her lap and Ridoc laying across her back...

They're all here.

Sloane with him, and Violet, Rhi, Ridoc, Sawyer, Cat, Maren, Baylor, Kai, Avalynn, Lynx, Daux, Abdullah, and even Kingston.

He'd only been gone for five hours.

"Guys?" he laughs, "Wake up."

He ends up sleeping on the floor of his room with fourteen other people who only ask about how he's feeling, and not once about what happened while Sloane observes him silently from his bed until they all fade into subconsciousness.

---

Dòrainn attends morning muster.

He seats himself between Fourth and Third Wing, watching silently while the squad leaders send their reports to their section leaders, and his milky eye flickers when Maiselle approaches Dain with the consolidated proceedings,

"So," she starts, after reporting all conditions normal, "You and the Duchess are now twins with twin dragons—and why aren't you on the dais with the other wingleaders?"

Dòrainn's neck extends over the two of them; he's listening.

"He's not mine He just does what he wants." Dain whispers, he crosses his arms and turns his back to the dais, choosing to face the rotunda instead,

Maiselle freezes.

“Then why the fuck are we standing this close?” she gapes, glancing back at Dòrainn so stiffly it seems like she _ticks_ every degree until the movement is completed.

Dain's brows knit; he was only standing a few yards further than he would've next to Cath—which was the normal distance between most riders—except Cath had a tendency to sloth closer over short periods of time. He looks at Maiselle with a confused grimace,

"This is a standard distance?"

Maiselle narrows her eyes into a hazel glare, "And you aren't up there—" she points at the dais, "—why? Everyone's all stiff cause you're down here."

Dain glances at the wing and they were more or less at attention, or stiffly faced forward,

"I'm sure you could guess Maiselle," he sighs, and tracks her observation.

Today, General Aetos decided he wanted to be present for morning formation, somehow impeccably on a day Cath chooses to lift his shields so far and thickly Dain can't even _f__eel_ a presence besides his own in their bond. His executive officer scowls when she spots his father's Brown scorpiontail perched against the masonry not to far behind him.

"Oh." she bites after noticing the General while dragging her eyes back to his, "Tracking."

Dain's lip twitches, "He's just been watching Dòrainn."

_"Who_ is that?" Maiselle asks; Dain points up at Dòrainn—who's bent his head down and observes them so closely the Wings watch _him_ watch the two of them,

"Oh. Where's your other dragon, I don't see him—"

His father's Brown flies just ahead of them and Dòrainn cranes his neck in her direction, then looks away in disinterest to blink back down at Dain.

Mealladh, Dain thinks while watching his father's dragon circle above Dòrainn, had always displayed characteristics complimentary of his father; they were a match made in the deepest pits of Malek's domain—scorned and miserable with everyone around them, and especially towards each other. His stomach turns as he realizes her intention.

"Let's get everyone off the courtyard before we have casualties from dragon friendly-fire." Dain suggests to Maiselle and they split down Fourth Wing on opposite sides, waving a hand to signify departure,

"What's wrong?" Maiselle shouts through the rustle of cadets as they regroup, "What's she doing?!"

Dain's heart squeezes, "She's... coming."

Their Wing breaks formation, spilling away and towards the rotunda in squads in perfect successions until Fourth dissolves with sharp discipline. Third lingers—unsettled, and First and Second leave as they notice Mealladh's descension to the courtyard.

"Go! Go!" Maiselle shouts through masses of black uniforms,

Dòrainn remains exactly where he landed, settled into the grassy courtyard like a monument half-swallowed by the earth. Rising runlight glints off the battered mosaic of his scales, highlighting old wounds, warped ridges, and sections where the plating never healed right. His weathered wings are folded, limbs relaxed, tail coiled neatly behind him.

His one good eye moves slow, deliberate, as if even looking requires consideration. He is utterly still—less like a creature among them, more like something older, watching time pass against Dain as he reapproaches him.

He doesn't watch the sky.

Only Dain.

"She's coming Dòrainn," he calls up to him in a panic, then he tears his eyes away from the Red's to Maiselle, "Go! They're only doing this because of me!"

"What about you?! You can't even speak to him!" Maiselle hollers, throwing her hands up as she backs up towards the rotunda,

What about him? Dain can't help Dòrainn, they can't speak and he doesn't have a combative signet, but he's so mangled already, there's no way he'd be able to—

Mealladh cuts in low from the side, talons like scythes and speed unbefitting her bulk. Her eyes shine—burning, seething—every inch of her coiled like a whip mid-snap.

Dòrainn doesn’t rise at her incoming trajectory.

He _rotates._

A single, massive limb shifts against the ground. Weight grinds into the earth and upheaves grass and dirt across the courtyard. And then—

His tail _snaps._

The impact lands square against Mealladh’s neck—no grace, no flair. Just sheer, cataclysmic force. It cracks against her like a rogue wave against an unsuspecting shoreline, and blood fans out like thrown paint.

The dais is showered in it—red, bright, sticky. The few professors scurry of the dais, and the wingleaders follow. One falls to their knees. But his father doesn't move. Not even to wipe the streaks trailing across his face, and Mealladh collapses mid-turn, skidding across the courtyard. Her neck rolls grotesquely, mouth hanging open, breath flapping in weak, uneven exhales that shiver the dirt.

Dòrainn begins to move—_slowly_. The way glaciers relocate incrementally over decades. He drags himself to the side with agonizing weight, ribs flexing, tattered wings flared across the courtyard. He places his body, inch by deliberate inch, between Dain and the sky.

A fortress of scale and ruin.

Mealladh recovers impressively quick—but not alone.

Thoirt descends like divine judgment.

The weight of her landing drives Mealladh into the ground again, this time with force enough to crater the courtyard. She thrashes—but _Sliseag_ is there next, sharp and clean, flanking, striking where there's an opening at her side. Mealladh wrenches free only after Thoirt is hurled from her back and her wings beat wildly, uneven and drenched in blood, as she claws her way into the sky.

Dain remains—standing beneath Dòrainn’s ribs, blinking slowly, as the Red rises to his full height.

Only the General does not retreat, he's still on the dais.

Blood paints the folds of his collar, his chest, his hands, the green of his top is black in the sunlight. It runs slowly in streaks down the back of his neck. He does not flinch. Does not blink. The muscle in his jaw twitches once—barely—but it’s there.

His eyes are fixed on his son, tucked away underneath Dòrainn’s belly, burning and red-faced. Shaking like someone who has just realized his hands are empty, and his grimy voice cracks through the field, carried by lesser magic like an afterthought,

"You were both always expendable_."_

Dòrainn, Thoirt, and Sliseag's heads rotate at sickly angles to him on the dais and finally, he stumbles backwards.

Dain can't help it—he _smiles._
