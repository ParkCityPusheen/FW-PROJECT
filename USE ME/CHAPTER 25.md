Though Aretia isn't the sprawling city it once was, the growing town is formidable. The townsfolk aren't like Navarrians, who prefer their far-northern cities paved over entirely, with the occasional curated splash of greenery. In Aretia, nature is embedded in the bones of the buildings themselves.

Dain admires it, as always—the twisting vines snaking around the corners of storefronts and townhomes, the beds of native flowers blooming between the walking paths and the main roads used by horses and caravans. Green winds between old brick and salvaged, fire-scarred wood, and somehow Aretia retains so much character, so much life against its mountainous backdrop, it nearly steals his breath.

He notes the staggered skyline of buildings, the workers scaling scaffolding on newer structures, and families perched on rooftop patios, enjoying the same view as him. Even up there, the plant life thrives—thick-stemmed, leafy greens the size of his body jut from corners and crawl along the edges of residential pockets. Manicured flowers bloom in windowsills, intentional and bright, each one a sign that someone has chosen beauty even in the middle of rebuilding.

“I didn’t want to pry,” Violet says, her voice even, “but I do want to be on the same page. So I can stand behind you in whatever you’ve decided—properly.”

She watches him with those piercing, blue-tinged hazel eyes. She’s in her leathers, her coronet braid neat as ever, and only two of her usual daggers strapped at her hips. The bistro they’d agreed to meet King Tauri’s treasurer and advisor at is packed—full of armed infantry disguised as civilians. Even directly behind them stands Ulices Ferris, who had insisted on being present for the discussion.

Violet had groaned that he had no reason to be there, but Ferris ignored her entirely and spoke to Dain instead.

He hates to admit it—but miserable old Ferris is starting to grow on him.

“I want a sizable piece for myself,” Dain says, smiling as he leans back. “Cath did gift it to me, after all.”

_Sizeable_ meant enough to sustain him for decades—and a full, matching set for Sloane.

“Naturally.” Violet returns the smile, soft and sweet, but there’s a flicker of sadness in her eyes before he even realizes it’s there.

“I kept a piece of Andarna’s shell,” she offers.

His face lights up. “You got to see her shell? That’s amazing. What’d you do with the rest—if you only kept a piece?”

He wonders, briefly, what Cath’s shell would look like—if it was the same red as his scales. If it would shine.

“King Courtlyn of Deverelli,” Violet says, setting her cup down with a gentle clink. She crosses her legs. “I wonder what he plans to do with it himself.”

“So?” she prompts.

“I want whatever proceeds I can get from the sale to go toward properly funding Aretia’s rebuilding. Independent arms. The college—whatever it needs once King Tecarus finalizes the funding guidelines. And—”

He points beyond the edge of town, where the buildings taper off into scattered neighborhoods and village plots.

“—a proper refugee asylum. For the Poromish, and anyone else who wants to come here in the future.”

Behind him, Ferris coughs emphatically. Violet crosses her arms.

“Just so we’re clear,” she says, “you’re okay putting that in writing?”

“Yes.”

He was more than sure.

The second Lupe named the figure, he knew exactly where the gold should go. Ferris had joked that Dain could keep it as a family heirloom—but there was no family, especially considering Cath didn't need gold or gems. Dain wanted no children. Of course, a part of him had considered sending it to Sloane. But that wasn’t something he could live with—not ethically, not honestly.

That didn’t stop him from imagining the ring he might one day make her. One she’d wear without shame.

His attention catches at the ring on Violet’s hand—a symbol so casual and yet so monumental.

“I’d like to secure the funds through the dukedom or guild ledger.”

"You don't want to use Navarre's Reserve?" Violet chokes.

Dain shakes his head and braces for the tongue-lashing.

“My father liquidated the account. The one under our family name.” he doesn’t look at her as he continues, “So I haven’t had anywhere to pull from. Or put gold. Everything since my start of service at Basgiath is somewhere I have no access to."

Ferris slams his fist into his table, and Violet exhales slowly.

"So this whole time you weren't _just_ busy." her words leave her mouth as lava snakes down volcanos, "You weren't eating because you couldn't?"

"That's the reason. But I—"

She lifts a hand, "Stop." Violet rubs her temples and the silence that stretches between them weighs heavy in the air,

"And you weren't comfortable with me enough to tell me?"

"Violet, for a good while nothing was comfortable enough to tell you. Not even hi. I didn't tell anyone, anyway." He wearily lets the admission leave him.

She sighs, but it explodes into a troubled groan, "I can't believe I let my relationship with you deteriorate like this."

Dain breathes in deep and lets his gaze rest on the view.

“It’s fine.”

The words barely clear his lips before both voices answer in tandem.

_“It’s not.”_

Cath is quick to expose his displeasure, _"You lost the ones you bonded to during threshing and after the pompous one was burned, you closed yourself to the other scaleless ones."_

Dain can hear his screech from the behind the foliage that obscures himself and Dòrainn mountaintops away,

_"All you had left was this one. She did not seek you out."_

"_Rightfully so._" Dain argues—he's answered by a threatening warble, and Violet lifts her head from where it had fallen to face the table in her frustration,

"Cath?"

Dain nods, "Cath."

"Well, let's hope this goes how we want it to." Violet grates while looking past him, "They're here."  
  

---

"Cath wants know when we'll be able to fly again."

Brennan shoots Dain a look like he’s just uttered sacrilege, then reaches under and pinches the skin behind his armpit hard,

"Cath’s flying just fine. You, last I checked, don’t have wings." 

_"I bear no patience for sarcasm. Is he in need of correcting?"_

Dain ignores Cath.

"You're making him mad." he teases, turning his head to the side to peer up at Brennan from the corners of his eyes, "Don't make him mad."

Brennan's signet stops and the magic between them dissipates, "I'm making him mad? He's driving _me_ mad—twice a day, everyday, whether from you or Marbh: _Cath wants to know this,_" he pinches Dain again, "_Cath says that._"

_"I would not have need for review if Marbh would train his rider correctly."_ Cath spits, as if Brennan can hear him,

"For Amari's sake, you're broken still and Melgren won't let anyone question your psychopath father or Nolon right now, so we can't properly diagnose whatever the hell is happening to you."

Brennan moves with precise irritation, threading around the healers without disrupting them, his voice flat and tired as it trails behind him.

_"Then I will fly to the cursed lands and question the Wretched One myself."_

"Cath says he's going back to Basgiath."

He doesn’t raise his voice, but the grip on Dain’s wrist and the cut of his stare make it clear—this is the line. Brennan shifts closer, careful not to jostle the others, his presence all the sharper for it.  

“No. Cath’s done enough damage we’re still answering for.”

Dain leans back into his chair, forcing the healer who places gauze over his sutures to halt his movements; he looks up at Brennan from where he crouches on the suite's floor when Dain speaks,

"I've already noticed that somethings gone awry—enough that Ulices Ferris has made himself a fixture around me. What exactly is going on that a General would hover?"

Brennan holds his stare for a few seconds, maybe even a minute, then clears his throat, "In regards to what?"

"The administrative building. I know my fucking dragon pranced across it like thatch roof, and I'm sure that doesn't happen without consequence."

"Actually, for _you_ it might not, but for him?” Brennan’s tone sharpens, and he absently scrapes his ink pen beneath his jaw.

"Have you asked Cath what has happened since you were evacuated from Basgiath?"

"I haven't."

He hasn't, but because his swordtail becomes unbearably irate if he does. It's been easier on him emotionally and mentally to accept that though his father might have not been in the right, Dain was the reason several dozen citizens were trampled to death, or crushed underneath rubble.

As with Liam and Soleil, someone else had lost a loved one. And Dain? He’d just walked back to Cath like it was any other day.

"I'm assuming he's not being very obliging?"

Dain turns his head to see the cliffside through the suite's wall of windows, "He doesn't like talking about things that hurt me. Outside of combat."

Brennan blinks, "Y'know, Xaden's dragon was really touchy about his personal life too."

He doesn't respond to that, but Dain does picture Sgaeyl being agitated about things happening to Riorson rather easily.

Did she like Violet? They could speak through bond, so what had their conversations been like? Tairn and Sgaeyl were as formidable as Cath.

"Dain, Cath relocated the rest of his den to Aretia."

"That makes sense. This is home base for me now, right?"

Brennan nods meekly. He makes quick work cleaning up their tools around them and sends off the healers with his notes, reports, and their equipment. As the suite door click shut behind them he gestures for Dain to join him in the sitting area,

"Ulices is making sure it happens."

Dain frowns—_what_ is he getting so involved in his life for?

"Why?"

"Your father plead his case before the Senarium and Ulices and Suri were the two I had to _beg_ to take your side as—"

He stops and Dain balks, rubbing his hands over his face, "As my what Brennan?"

His breath leaves him like its a damn curse to even have functioning lungs and as he readies to speak again, he straightens his back along the cushioned support of the couch,

"As your human criterion since your father has been ruled liable in your development, Cath is your Empyrean one."

"So you know?" Dain croaks, "About me?"

"I do, and I don't think there's anything wrong with you."

Dain sneers, nearly spits at him, "Yet. Right."

When he sees Brennan’s face crumple with good intention, he nearly _screams._ Yes—principally, it was all well and good that the few people he'd trusted had seen past the factual, genetic atrocity of his existence and claimed to see _him._ In the harsh light of reality, however: his history, his temperament, his self-control—none of it might matter. Not forever.

He could collapse from the unbearable weight of their kindness. It presses him into a cage. Yes, they saw him—but what did that matter, when one day he might become the thing they couldn’t unsee?

The half of him that lay dormant still pulsed with possibility. A possibility that could one day bleed the color out of Aretia, drain the magic from their veins, and strip even their dragons to grayscale.

"Anyway, hasn't he always been?" he heaves, rushing the words out in breathless disbelief,

Brennan looks away for moment, "No. It was Codagh before, he's just finally let Cath fall into the role."

"Right. And this all has what to do with the Red's den?"

When had he ever been around Codagh to be properly observed by him at length that the Black swordtail could formulate a synopsis on his conditions. He reaches for Cath but his Red opts to listen instead of explain, as per his usual and Dain's frustration begins to peak.

"The Red's are now refusing to bond this year. And there's no telling for how long."

"We can't—there already aren't _any_ Black dragons, we can't afford this. It could be detrimental to our forces, the capabilities we might not discovers without them. I—"

His thoughts are already shifting—calculating. The loss isn’t just symbolic, it’s tactical. Red dragons, with their combat affinity and aggressive temperaments, filled a critical gap in the air: power and range, reinforced by signets. Without them, entire formations weaken.

And the Black dragons? They never bonded. They were myth in scale and theory—silent and unseen for decades. With both the Reds and Black dragons removed from the bondable pool, what happens if other dragons follow? If the Blues or Browns begin to hold back? If the sky thins, rider by rider, while venin multiply in numbers they still can’t quantify?

It would leave them blind. Defenseless. Outnumbered in a war no longer balanced by magic.

“We can’t—there already aren’t any Black dragons, we can’t afford this. It could be detrimental to our forces, the capabilities we might not discover without them. I—”

Dain breaks off as he scrambles to stand, wincing as pain spreads down his legs while he lifts from the couch. His body isn’t ready, but it doesn’t matter—he turns and limps toward the terrace, where Cath stands at the cliff’s edge, waiting.

He swings the double doors open and Cath lowers himself against the rocks, eyes watching him with eerie judgement, unblinking and heated, fixed downwards. _Gods_ he was so loved by this creature. It was his divine blessing and yet his greatest curse all the same.

"You can't let this happen."

_"I have, and I will continue to do so."_ His bond seethes, _"Their crimes will not go unpunished."_

"Please Cath—"

_"Listen to me."_ he barks, Dain watches pupils dilate, expanding into black columns from their cat-eye slivers,

_"I will make my choices for you where I can, and you will accept them."_

"Oh, will I?" Dain snaps, leaning over the balcony, "How is this any different from what my father was doing to me?!"

Cath's tail slices through the air, disrupting the cliff beneath him and boulders the size of his bed tumble down into the foggy cavern beneath.

_"Because I would never hurt you."_

"But this could hurt more people, the people around me Cath, you can't just not allow the other Red's to bond because of me."

_"The decision made was one determined by majority."_

His garnet head lowers over the cliffside and his jowls drop open, releasing billowing, sulfuric steam against Dain and into the enclave,

_"I have no concern for humans that are not you."_

Dain's eyes twitch.

Three dozen people dead because Cath trampled over them to get to his human, and he's not even entirely that. He lifts his shields and drops to the paved floor, watching Cath watch him. 

They stay like this until he gets up to shower and sleep.  
  

---

Riorson house's library is a far cry from the small one available to rider's in the citadel, and even the archives. 

The second story of the fortress' library is quiet, save for the soft hush of turned pages and the distant creak of beams settling above the vaulted ceiling. Light spills through stained glass in fractured, colored pieces—purples, reds, a rich cobalt blue that cuts across the woodgrain floor like water. The entire ceiling is domed, its arch held aloft by wide wooden rafters that mimic smaller ones throughout the house.

Dain cranes his head upward as he enters, watching the interplay of color and shadow dance across the inner curve of the dome. He’s always liked this place—admired the way Aretia's library doesn't shut the world out, but lets it in. Vines creep through open-latticed windows, and between shelves, the faint scent of mountain air and parchment mingles like an old memory.

At night this place embodies Asher Sorrengail; admirable and full of wonder.

“Violet?” he calls out, voice low, respectful of the quiet but firm enough to carry.

It echoes once, then disappears into the warm hush of the mezzanine.

He spots her a second later—silhouetted in the watercolor spill of a rose-stained window, perched at a desk half-buried in parchment and annotated schematics.

“Rune work?”

Violet sighs. She seems caught in the blueprints—or maybe they have her, 

“Of what’s being tempered into the migrant center. The one you and Squadron have helped build so quickly, even the nobles have started joking about hiring you all for town labor projects.”

Kiandra and Trissa had been the ones to push for rune integration alongside construction—mage lighting, temperature regulation, basic protective warding. Things that were standard in places like Riorson House and Basgiath, but rare elsewhere.

She leans back in her seat and blinks up at him. “What’s up?”

“Why do _you_ have the project documents?”

She tilts her head, puzzled. “I’m the Duchess of this province. I have to approve all architectural rune work at this scale.”

“Will you?” he asks, voice soft as he takes the seat across from her.

“Of course.”

The Migrant Receiving Center hadn’t been his idea—not entirely. It was Radomirka Greer, a flier and Major in their Squadron, who had drawn up the plans and presented them to King Tauri, who then forwarded them to the Assembly. The chamber had agreed quickly enough—Tauri offered to fund the project, and once Dain was paid out for Cath’s so-called graduation gift, he consolidated a sizeable amount of gold toward supporting the new villages cropping up along the southern edge of Aretia.

He’d been on-site fifteen times so far, and the speed of the build remained one of the most impressive things he’d witnessed.

“King Tauri has asked you to title the center officially,” Violet says, offering a missive across the table.

“Telery Receiving Center, then.”

The name hangs in the quiet, rising into the vaulted ceiling above them and catching in the stained glass light. He doesn’t meet Violet's eyes. He watches the color instead—sun-warmed streaks of rose and sapphire shifting across the polished surface of the table between them.

“Are you sure?” she asks. 

Her voice is light, unlike the memory of what Soleil went through protecting civilians. Unlike her unfortunate fate.

"I have to give back. It wasn't for nothing—her passing."

Violet sniffs and looks back down at the schematics, "I think her family will really appreciate this."

“Do they know she died because of me?”  his question is carried wearily by the gentle tone of his voice; fine details like that were probably lost on them in the light of losing a daughter, but he couldn't be sure, "Should I go apologize?"

"Your _father_ is the one who sent cadets to an uncertain future, Dain—not you."  

Her voice cuts through the hush of the second story, louder than anything spoken in the library all day. Colored light fractures across her face as she leans forward, gold and red and deep violet casting sharp lines down her cheekbones. "So no, they don't."

He taps his finger against their table, "When construction is done will you... tell them?"

"About a the center meant to continue saving lives like she had? Yes."

Dain nods, but his gaze lingers on the schematic between them. Inked lines, careful scrawls, outlines for temporary housing.

“It’s strange,” he says. “How something like this starts as a sketch, and ends up sheltering hundreds.”

Violet hums. “That’s the point, isn’t it? We can’t bring back what we’ve lost. But we can choose what rises in its place. Kiandra is even making a program to help the migrants settle in until the Poromish find a way to push venin back."

“Good,” Dain says. “It might stop them from preying on vulnerable citizens inside the wards.”

Violet tilts her head. “You think they’re preying on the Poromish? _Here?_”

“Why wouldn’t they?” His voice is steady, but grim. “They’ve been doing it in Poromiel for the last fifty years. If they’re crossing into Navarre now, that suggests desperation—running low on ground, low on options. If I were Poromish, I’d see this as the end of the line.”

He leans forward, voice dropping.

“And that’s not even accounting for how riders treat fliers—or Poromish citizens in general. The reputation alone paints a target on their backs.”

“Weak hearts and minds,” Violet mutters under her breath.

“Easy prey,” he echoes, "Can't beat them... join them. I'm sure whole families could be convinced if it means surviving together."

She groans, dragging a hand down her face. “We’re talking about this like it’s going to change the outcome of the war.”

_Foolish,_ he thinks. But he keeps his tone calm.

“It _is._ Fliers and riders are drafted every year, but with Cliffsbaine gone, their homes burned or overrun, they need a place to reestablish—somewhere they can train, regroup, rebuild. That’s why the secondary school in Aretia isn’t as outlandish as people are gossiping it is. This is the safest place left for fliers to train.”

“And the gryphons aren’t against relocating.”

Dain’s mouth pulls into a thin, tired line. “They don’t have a choice. It’s that or die. Unless we get a breakthrough soon, they’ll have to nest here—along the cliffs in Tyrrendor.”

“That's why the Assembly suggested the schoolhouse be modeled after Riorson House.”

He gives a knowing shrug.

“Fliers will be bonding within Tyrrish wards,” Violet says, and her eyes flash with something like wonder. “That’s… incredible.”

“Isn’t it?”

“I’d love to see that in motion,” she murmurs. “Jumping off the cliffs here? Absolutely insane.”

“I don’t even like looking over the terrace in my suite,” he admits. “Feels like there’s just a rocky death waiting for me down there.”

Violet smiles faintly. “I wasn’t sure why the Assembly approved the migrant center construction so quickly—but I’m starting to think it’s a test. The Poromish are helping build it too, aren’t they? Carving runes, working the quarried stone.”

“Stones were the giveaway.” Dain nods. “We’re lucky Squadron’s dragons agreed to transport. This is happening fast because the dragons and gryphons are doing everything they can. Everyone is. And it's making a difference nobody calculated.”

Violet doesn’t stop him when he reaches for the parchment. Her fingers linger for a beat too long against the edge of the page before letting go. He takes the schematics from her since she hasn't looked over them for a moment, sunlight flutters across the paper in rose and sapphire streaks. He reads the margin notes without speaking.

“This would never happen in Navarre,” she mutters. “Gods, the thought alone is enough to make my skin crawl.”

Dain’s smile doesn’t reach eyes, “Picture it—thousands of children, dead. Not because they had to be, but because someone decided that only the few were worth a shot at life.”

"I can't." Violet grunts,

She’s watching him when he glances up from the blueprints, and her voice is softer than expected when she asks,  

“So—what brings you here?”

“The Reds. And Threshing.”

Her eyes slide shut in quiet exasperation. “Cath have lockjaw?”

“You sound like someone who’s also got a stubborn old man lodged in her skull.”  

His tone shifts—less teasing, more hollow. Shielding from Cath all morning has scraped him raw, and it shows in the slump of his shoulders, in the way he feels exhausted even though he hasn't done any training yet.

“His name is Tairn,” Violet mutters, rolling her eyes and her whole head back over the chair. “You should meet him sometime. Real charmer.”

Dain huffs a humorless breath, then leans forward, elbows braced against the wood.    
“Do you know the details?” he asks quietly. “More than Brennan?”

“It’s not because of you—it’s your father,” she says, and as the conversation moves on, he studies her posture, her tone, whatever she’s ready to reveal isn't bothering her in the slightest,

"Deigh—Liam’s dragon—was a Red who died because of your father’s abuse of power. And Cath nearly losing his life recently, had you died, triggered a shift in the Red den’s tolerance of him.”

Dain’s heart twists. 

Now, though, the den’s refusal to bond takes on a clearer shape, one sharpened by grief and consequence. Of course they would pull away—how could they not, after watching one of their own die at the hands of Dain’s father, and another nearly follow in his wake?

He wouldn’t risk his family either—not when he’s seen how quickly loyalty can become liability, how easily affection becomes a weapon in the hands of men like his father, how love, in the end, becomes the price.

Shielding is like holding your breath underwater. At first, it’s easy—automatic. You don’t notice the effort until your lungs begin to ache and your thoughts spiral toward a singular truth: _you can’t breathe._ You wait either until it’s safe to surface, or until you reach that narrow middle ground riders seek, where withholding breath becomes as natural and bearable as breathing itself, and in that delicate balance, you earn privacy. Or you hold out until something inside you gives way, unable to sustain the cost of silence any longer.

On its own, shielding is manageable. But against a dragon—_your_ dragon—you add the element of an aggressor who always, inevitably, overpowers you.

They take the element of choice away from you, and while you flail beneath the surface, your mind begins to unravel. The pressure gathers slowly, curling around your chest, rising through your throat, until instinct overtakes intention. You try to hold on, but it presses in from every side. You open your mouth to breathe—

"Dain?"

"Sir?"

—And you—you breathe _him_ in—

"_Do not hide from me!_"

"Buddy you are just sweatin' up a storm, what's going on?"

"He's panicking, Raury shake him down, get him out of there. His shields are so fucking solid I can't tell if he's wielding or not."

Dain loses track of time.

The room drifts to the edge of his awareness, like a dream half-faded or a voice carried off by wind. His thoughts stretch thin across the bond, twisted and scattered, too much of Cath in them—too much of _himself_. Something unspools inside his chest and it doesn’t stop, just keeps unwinding, dragging every grounded thought with it.

And then—softly, without force—Don slips in.

Not like Cath. Not loud or blazing. She moves through the cracks he didn’t know were open, draws a line between his frantic pulse and the edges of her calm. The tether is immediate. Full-bodied. Her intent steadies his own as if she’s laying a hand across his chest from somewhere far away, asking nothing. 

_Just breathe._ Not a command. A presence.

Somewhere nearby, Lucian stirs the current. Dain doesn’t hear him speak—not yet—but the pressure in his skull shifts. That corner of his mind where panic bloomed starts to lean elsewhere, its weight redistributed with quiet insistence. The fear is still there, but it’s no longer the center. His mind angles toward solid ground without realizing it’s moved.

He exhales slowly, tries to push back up through the haze. It feels like dragging a body out of thick mud—slow, effortful, and humiliating. But the bond goes quiet enough for him to remember how to stand beneath it.

Cath remains, seething in the distance. Dain leaves him there, closes his ramparts again.

"_Dunne,_" His words are flayed by his heavy breathing, "thank you guys, thank you."

Raury watches him with dark brown eyes that would be easily mistaken for black if not for the reflection of mage light off the packed earthen soil of his irises. He sits cross-legged on the floor, his frame small but dense—stocky like a mountain fox. His close-shaved scalp glints under the enchantment lamp overhead, and the slope of his shoulders is permanently tilted like he’s always mid-turn toward mischief,

"Can't shield him out forever, sir."

Dain twists his fingers through his hair, ruining the curls, "I can try."

Don and Lucian lean back against the edge of the couch; they're both sitting on the floor braced against the front of Sven and Radomirka's legs. He watches the group of fliers as they observe him for any more signs of distress,

"I would advise _not_ pissing off the dragon." Mirka scolds, pinching her brows together. Radomirka's expressions are only carved from stone, sharp and immovable, and her posture—straight-backed, arms folded over her chest—radiates the kind of still authority that makes even the rowdiest fliers go quiet.

"I didn't ask for everyone to stop by to be lectured." He tone carries a harsh rasp of irritation that makes the fliers' heads tilt a bit, he wipes sweat away from his face while speaking again, "I want to prepare a gift but I need help creating it."

"Creating it?" Raury echoes, "What? Like... a hairpin? Boots?"

"A weapon—a glaive. A tempered glaive for a siphon."

Sven, the tallest man he's ever worked alongside, whistles, "The Tyrrish runemaster house's heir? Wouldn't she want a nice dress or something?"

"Yes... how do you know who I'm talking about?"  
  
It’s not surprise that catches at him, but recognition—of how fliers like Sven, especially those old enough or ranked high enough to speak out of turn, made it their business to remember which riders carried dangerous gifts and the histories that came with them. It wasn’t personal. It never was. But the knowing settles over him like a hand pressed too long between his shoulder blades, and he feels the heat of it curl along his spine.

"Every Flier knows the Miari's." Lucian deadpans.

"That house trained a lot of the best rune weavers in Poromiel. Real gracious folks; never treated fliers indifferently."

Radomirka presses her fingers into Don's hair and answers instead of Sven, "It's matron spent a lot of time by where I'm from in Cygnisen creating protection wards out of runed jewels. Originally it was assumed our province would fall first, but seeing Braevick now..."

"There won't be a survey until a few months as well." Sven's tone shifts, "Not sure if you heard that Tecarus is holding off longer than usual."

Dain stands up to change his shirt, and starts unlacing it as he steps over the fliers, "A survey?"

Don's voice raises slowly from where she sits cross-legged, and she presses her scalp harder against Mirka's fingers as he staggers by, "When Poromiel loses territory to Venin a survey team is dispatched to properly observe and record the damage. They look for survivors, resources, and possible weaknesses."

"When venin take cities they turn them into strongholds; they won't just drain it of all it's worth. They'll post up civilians outside cities and towns, villages, whatever, try to make those who escaped return."

Sven recalls this while staring out the wall of windows ahead of himself—Dain nearly drops his shields to plunder his memories of this, but that would mean giving Cath an opportunity to infiltrate his mind again.

"For what?" He drops his tunic onto the bed and peaks past the curtain divider, narrowing his eyes when he sees Daux has plopped into his spot on the sofa,

"It's bait, I've heard of dark wielders forcing humans to turn but I've never seen it myself." Sven coughs, and leans forwards.

Dain doesn't answer right away, and his wrists ache before he remembers why.

The scent returns first—damp stone, rusted iron. Then the weight of chains, heavy and unrelenting, dragging from his shoulders to his hands where they were fixed to the floor. He can still feel the sharp pull where the shackles had been cinched too tight, where his skin had blistered and split. There's nothing else he can do but kneel and wait while Alloces stalked the perimeter of his cell, whispering promises, loaded threats, and eventualities.

The memory drags like blood over broken glass, catching at every thought, when Cath rears again, digging and gnawing at his shields. A pounding, punishing pressure against the inside of his mind, slamming into the ramparts with the full weight of fury and panic. His vision wavers. The bond vibrates, then burns. The force of Cath's demand is deafening, a battering storm that wants _in_ and _now_.

“Wait—this gift,” Daux interrupts, one of the only other riders in the suite, circumventing back to Sloane “you want me to make the blade, right? I can carve a good shaft too—maybe something long and balanced, we could—”

“Just give her _your_ shaft,” Lucian says, the line so languid and deliberately obnoxious that Mirka leans over and smacks the side of his leg without looking.

Daux’s head jerks up in open disbelief, eyebrows climbing as the pieces connect. “Wait—you have a thing for Colonel Mairi’s daughter?”

Before he can get another word in, Mirka’s hand cracks across Sven’s arm with even more force and his mouth shuts slowly, stopping himself from speaking.

Dain opens his mouth to argue, but the protest catches. It feels wrong against his teeth.

“I do.”

The admission sits easily on his tongue. As right as he felt inside her, and beside her. What’s wrong with loving someone? So what if his fingers always itched to touch her when she was near. And so fucking _what_ if his father hated everything she represented.

So what if the people closest to him knew?

Violet’s friends had known about Riorson. Sharing things like this—_personal_ things—was part of being close to people. Wasn’t it?

He walks out of the enclave tugging a soft long-sleeved shirt over his head, still flushed from the crash and the aftermath, and Cath's current assault.

Daux is lounging, one foot up on the low table, his heavy boots leaving faint scuffs. He’s thickly built, with rust-red curls cropped short and a dusting of freckles at the bridge of his nose. His shirt hangs open where he hasn’t finished buttoning it—typical. The Captain stares at him, brows nearly halfway to his hairline.

“I wasn’t expecting you to just—”

“—to what? Admit it?” Dain cuts in, too tired to bother dodging. “I mean… we’re not like—look, don’t harass me.” He drops his head into his hands. “We’re still figuring it out, and we don’t know each other very well.”

“You do know she was sent to some Loyalist Baron and Baroness in Calldyr for _reeducation_, right? Bet that girl doesn’t even know who she is anymore.”

The words hang. They aren’t cruel—just unsettled and Sven doesn’t look at him as he says it. Whatever happened to her clearly sits wrong with him.

Dain runs his hands down his face and stares at the floor between his boots, but the quiet doesn’t stay quiet for long. His mind drags her forward again—her voice, her mouth, the way she held him like it meant something—he’s already cataloging every second they’ve spent close. He wants more than just proximity. He wants every detail she’s never said aloud. He wants to ask her questions that don’t sound like questions, that pull truths from her without her realizing she’s giving them away. He wants her fears, her childhood, the name of the first place she felt safe. He wants to know if she hates the mornings and whether she ever sang in the shower. He wants the sound of her laugh when no one’s listening. He wants the worst thing she’s ever done and the way she’ll look at him after she says it.

He wants to hear every bit of detail about Sloane's family, about the brother his father stole away from her, what her mother taught her—the bedtimes stories her father might've read to her. Dain want the names, faces, and places of her foster family. He needs to know how they treated her and if it were good or bad, consequentially how quickly he needed to rise in rank and nobility to ruin them slowly, before hanging their bodies from metal hooks after burning down their estates depending on her answer.   
  
He should be disturbed by the thought, by the fantasy of hanging men from meat hooks and salting the ground beneath their estates. But it doesn’t matter that he’d raze entire bloodlines for answers she hasn’t even spoken aloud. But he isn’t. If anything, it calms him—knowing there’s nothing he wouldn’t do.

And Gods help him, he’ll take it all in pieces if he has to—coax it, lure it, steal it—every last bit she’s willing to give, and the ones she doesn’t mean to. He’ll find them anyway. She’s already in woven into his mind; what’s left but to let her flood his soul?

"You think reeducation could graze even the outsides of the anger that's still probably brewing within her?" he finally whips out, lifting his head and glaring at Sven.

Sven drapes his arm along the back of his and Mirka's sofa; one of her braids catches against his finger and he toys with it absentmindedly, "Just remember that you couldn't trust your own father, _Sir._"

"She isn't my father, _Captain._"

Abdullah snaps the thread of tension between them with trained ease, "Sloane Mairi’s personal life isn’t yours to speak on, Sven. And Dain—stop letting him and Gale under your damn skin.”

"I'm not even in there right now, what the fuck?!" Gale shouts from the terrace,

"She's got a lot of eyes on her right now, and is severely under performing. Her brother—"

Dain steps close to Sven, his thighs brush the edge of the sofa's arm, "She isn’t her brother—not in training, not in education. She hasn’t even told _me_ about her past. I would also appreciate you not badmouthing the woman I'm pining for while I'm standing right in front of you—"

"I'm saying—"

"I'm not _finished._" His voice cuts low, steady—but biting.

"_Clearly._" Cath drawls, _"Do go on. This speech will be remembered for generations. The day the flightleader nearly wept for a girl who hasn’t even told him her favorite color."_

Dain grits his teeth. He stops mid-blink, the stutter catching in his posture for a split second—the same second that allowed Cath to slip through the cracks left behind by thinking of Sloane. They’re too wide now to patch without turning his full focus inward, without giving Cath his undivided attention, and he can’t afford that—not when Sven still needs correcting. Sloane would be treated with the respect she deserved, whether she stood here to demand it herself or not.

"_No, no—don’t stop now. The anger, the hair-raking—shall I fan you while you pace?_"

"_Go away._" Dain lobs the threat out loosely and Cath whips it right back,

"_Make me._"

"You don't get to judge a first year cadet on her accomplishments when she's been thrown into a pit of Navarrian snakes who would love nothing more than to see her dead and peel the rebellion relic off her fucking arm while she watches. Sloane is the entire reason Basgiath can continue to cower behind their wards."

"Damn _Dragon_, relax. Just wondering how deep she’s got her claws in, that’s all." Sven _tsks_ at him as if any of this were a joke,

“Vice grip apparently,” Lucian’s hair is pulled back into a loose tie, his locs fraying around his temples. Gold beads glint between the dark strands near his crown. He’s wearing a half-buttoned uniform shirt, sleeves rolled up, forearms inked with low-drafted Poromish script. “Must be _really_ tight.”

He flashes Dain with his blindingly white teeth, and Dain momentarily pictures them as a fucking necklace.

Vice grip didn’t even begin to cover it.

He would die for her; not in the vague, abstract way infantry romanticized sacrifice. He meant in practice. In fire. In the ruin that would be required to end the venin once and for all. He’d offer up every piece of himself just to make sure she had enough time left in the world to live, and not survive—to _live_. To take long, pointless flights with Thoirt wherever they please, to run her hands over carved stone, to breathe freely without the taste of war in her mouth. He’d give her that. Gladly.

And he would die with the memory of her against him still intact—her hair brushing across his throat, her warmth wrapped around him like silk, her cerulean eyes narrowed with focus as she read from one of their textbooks, lips moving silently while students spoke over each other on every side, none of it breaking her concentration.

He sees that image now—her face half-obscured beneath a curtain of gold, brow furrowed, handwriting angled into the corner of a borrowed page as if the lecture wasn’t even happening—and nearly sighs aloud.

“Mind yours,” he grunts at Lucian, jaw tight, hoping his flier doesn’t press him any further.

_"I do enjoy when you perform, truly. It's like watching a fish walk across land."_ Cath harks, 

"Oh my fucking—"

He steps away from them again rubbing his beard, _"Go away."_

_"No."_

_"Break the bond."_ Dain says through clenched teeth, he keeps their shared wasteland from forming in his mind.

_"You first."_

"Cath?" Abdullah asks from his desk, eyes thin with suspicion.

"Cath." Dain answers; he's mentally exhausted and honestly, ready to sleep.

_"Yes, Cath, the reason you have even a fraction of the strength required to—"_

The rest of Cath's tirade pours in unbidden, rising in volume and sharpness with each thought. Dain presses the heel of his palm to his brow and breathes through it, refusing to engage. The bond vibrates with Cath’s outrage, but Dain holds his ramparts almost shut.

“I’m going to sleep. If you’re still here when I wake up, don’t be.”

"Good luck with _that_." Don smirks, pointing at her head.

Sven whistles a tune on his way out, but stops to speak just before being snatched away by Daux,

"You wanna beat off to blondie you could've just—"

_"Look at you; you’re so composed. Remind me again—who’s supposed to be the beast in this bond?"_

He doesn't respond.

And no.

Cath does not let him sleep.
