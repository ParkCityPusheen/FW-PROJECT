Sloane's panic builds, and builds, and *builds* in their pathways until finally, while maintaining an impressive poker-face, she expresses one of the sweetest smiles he's seen from her yet.

But, it's not for him.

It's for fucking Imogen.

Imogen stands frozen just ahead of the sitting area, taut with lethal intention, one hand already wrapped around the hilt of a dagger sheathed at her hip, and her thumb rested against its crossguard.

"Let's stick to the point, Imogen, remember what's at stake here." Maiselle's voice rasps with strain, feverish and urgent, her words catching on each breath as she struggles to maintain her hold; her other hand presses against her reddened nose, trying to staunch the coming flow of blood while keeping Imogen anchored.

Imogen's face sours; she pays no mind to Maiselle's restraint or Sven's positioning near the door, her attention has narrowed to a singular focus that tunnels everything else into peripheral static. Her eyes lock onto his, then slide to Sven's face in calculated assessment.

"Do you not hear me—" she begins just as Sloane decides to speak,

*"Don't say anything."* Sloane's command echoes in his mind with sharp urgency as she pushes off the sofa, leaving his arm lukewarm and unoccupied; the sudden absence of her weight makes the cushions shift beneath him, *"I've only ever said horrible things about you to Imogen. It was my way of coping."*

*"Coping with what?"*

He asks, though he already knows the answer. Sloane turns her head just enough to make eye contact with him before exposing him to the complex shame she feels, and the bond between them quivers with the force of her guilt.

*"The one thing that all three of us will never get over, Dain."*

Once she's just ahead of Imogen, Dain watches as she pulls her friend into a tight hug, tighter than he'd ever seen her embrace Avalynn. It makes him wonder just how close the two are. How long they've known each other. His eyes drop to his lap and he sighs realizing that other men aren't the only things that will leave him scathingly jealous about her.

"Mo," Sloane's speech is a long exhale of breath that makes her shoulders drop while her arms wrap around Imogen, "aren't you supposed to be in Chakir?"

Imogen hand drops from her dagger, her left she wrenches free from Maiselle's grip, the slowly she returns Sloane's embrace.

Never once do her eyes slip away from Dain's person.

"I was, but I caught wind of some gossip," she pulls away and kisses Sloane's cheek, "and if any of it is true I'm certain I could be more helpful here."

The tension in the room shifts subtly, and Dain feels an instance of exigency settle against his shoulders like a heavy blanket. It's Sven's signet; he recognizes the careful control of it in way the feeling doesn't invade but instead exists alongside everything else happening. When he glances toward the door, Sven's already watching him, his expression neutral but focused. Dain remembers how the flier used to look at him with open distrust, how Sven had been one of the last in Squadron to accept his command.

Then the feeling changes, it becomes more pointed: the urge to listen, to pay attention to something beyond Imogen, to *Sven*. He lets his focus linger on Sloane a moment longer before facing Sven who's pushed the door shut and now stands in front of it, positioning himself between the suite and whoever might be gathering in the hallway beyond. The movement is purposeful, protective; Sven is actively managing the space, controlling access, ensuring whatever conversation happens here stays contained.

"Yes?" Dain murmurs to Sven, hushed under the sounds of Sloane and Imogen's discussion,

"I was coming to check on you after what that old man did during the meeting, but I see that your fine." He jerks his chin upwards and at Sloane, and then his eyes slide to Imogen, assessing the threat with the same careful calculation Dain sees during their patrols together, "Though I'm not sure the same can be said for your current company."

Dain nods, "It's all fine."

"You sure? I could kill him. He's not a representative anymore." Sven's voice is quiet, but there's no humor in it now; his attention is split between Dain and the room, watching Imogen's hand on her dagger, tracking Maiselle's grip, monitoring Sloane and Cat all the same.

"He's still one of King Tauri's advisors."

Sven clicks his tongue, "What a shame. We'll have to keep an eye out for him, not sure who he's aligned with after that theatre production he just gave—but it's obvious whomever it is doesn't want you straying any further from Navarre's grasp."

"Too late." Dain says it quietly, and Sven's expression softens just enough that Dain knows he understands, Sven's mouth opens to say something else and Dain feels Sloane's panic spike through their bond like a lightning strike. She's nearly shaking while pulling away from Imogen and his attention fractures; he's trying to listen to whatever Sven is about to tell him while simultaneously feeling Sloane's anxiety ratchet up, her emotions tumbling over each other in their pathway.

"Dain," Cat's voice cuts through his and Sven's conversation in a gleeful tone, "you might want to pay attention to this."

He shifts his attention back to Sloane and Imogen, who've also done the same and now watch himself and Sven,

"I promise you you're overreacting," Sloane says, but her voice comes too fast, and Dain can feel through their bond that she's trying to be calm and measured; she wants to be steady, wants to handle this with grace, wants to approach Imogen with the same careful thoughtfulness she's shown in their conversations. Her arm raises and gestures to Dain, "But nothing is happening that I didn't ask for."

Imogen's brow creases, "What?"

*"You don't have to do this."* Dain reassures her through their bond, his voice soft, but he's aware of Cat watching him, aware of Sven still positioned at the door, aware that he's trying to manage too many things at once, *"I don't know what your relationship with Imogen is like but I don't want you—"*

Sloane's eyes snap to his, wide, panicked, *"She would never walk away from me because of someone else. Especially not someone I'm choosing."*

Her dissuasion amounts to nothing under the tension in their bond; Dain feels her discomfort, the impending disapproval she's gearing up for stabbing both of them at once.

He's not worth being chosen over someone already established in her life.

"We—"

Dain lifts off of the sofa, "Sloane, *stop.*"

He winces when his heart's harbor glances at him with her cerulean eyes glazed over, "I don't need you to make this decision for me. Sit."

His body collides back into the couch, and Sloane brushes against him in their pathway,

*"Good boy."* she coos.

During the pause in Sloane's explanation, Maiselle's gaze drifts to Dain's throat again, her brow furrowing slightly before her eyes widen with realization. She looks at Sloane, then back at Dain's throat again before cocking her head to the side.

"Thoirt and Cath are bonded." Sloane announces, blinking when Sven presses the suite door shut; he casts a sound shield across it and looks directly at Dain with a shocked expression and his inky black eyebrows lifted.

Sloane continues, "But before this happened Dain and I—"

"Sloane do you have any fucking idea—"

"Mo, listen to me!"

She straightens out her back and juts her chin out, head lifting to give Imogen an indignant glare.

She might as well have stomped her foot and pouted too, she's so damned cute.

"We kind of—"

Maiselle throws her arms and hands out facing Dain, "Your *neck,* it was Mairi?! Is that why she wasn't at muster?"

"What?" Dain groans before the memories of Maiselle asking about the hickeys on his neck smack into him so hard he nearly gets whiplash, "Maiselle... now is the wrong time."

"There's no way, you guys *hate* each other." Maiselle gawks, eyes bouncing from Sloane, then back to him, "And you're her Wingleader."

"Hate fucking someone is so much better than just hating someone. Isn't this such a comedic parallel of Sorrengail and Riorson at this point." Catriona purrs from the chaise.

The color fades away from Imogen's face and Sloane panic booms so hard in the bond, that braiding magic in their pathway separates into a fine mist,

"You let him *fuck* you?" Imogen gasps.

Sloane shuffles next to Imogen, "Look he didn't—I wanted it, *I* fucked *him.*"

"Oh. Kinky." Sven whistles.

Dain coughs, she didn't mean to say it like that did she?

"Sloane, no—" he beings when Imogen's head snaps upwards, 

"What kind of odd Navarrian shit are you forcing her to partake in Aetos?" she hisses, shouting over them both, "I need you to get to talking now. Stop acting like you suddenly don't love running your fucking mouth."

His eyes slide to Sloane before responding, as he watches Imogen cut Sloane off and demand explanations on her own terms, insert herself into a conversation that Sloane was trying to have with just the two of them her own terms. He sees it then, the pattern he knows too well because he's lived it from the other side; all those times Violet had tried to explain herself, when she'd tried to tell him something important, and he'd trampled right over her autonomy, inserted himself where he'd decided he was needed, made her decisions for her because he'd convinced himself he knew better.

He'd done it thinking he was protecting her, thinking he was helping, but he'd been stealing her voice, her agency, her right to speak for herself.

And now here's Imogen doing the exact same thing to Sloane; cutting her off, demanding answers, refusing to let Sloane explain on her own terms, treating her like she can't handle her own conversations, like she needs someone else to speak for her. The recognition is acidic, and he absolutely fucking hates it. He hates that he understands exactly what Sloane is feeling right now because he's the one who used to make Violet feel this way.

"Sloane is right next to you, but you're talking to me like she doesn't exist. If you want answers, ask the person who's actively trying to give them to you." he snaps, patience thinned and all but whittled away.

"Hey, I don't need you to tell me how to treat me people. In fact you'd be the last person I'd ever—"
