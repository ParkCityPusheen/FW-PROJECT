Sloane's panic builds, and builds, and *builds* in their pathways until finally, while maintaining an impressive poker-face, she expresses one of the sweetest smiles he's seen from her yet.

But, it's not for him.

It's for fucking Imogen.

Imogen stands frozen just ahead of the sitting area, taut with lethal intention, one hand already wrapped around the hilt of a dagger sheathed at her hip, and her thumb rested against its crossguard.

"Let's stick to the point, Imogen, remember what's at stake here." Maiselle's voice rasps with strain, feverish and urgent, her words catching on each breath as she struggles to maintain her hold; her other hand presses against her reddened nose, trying to staunch the coming flow of blood while keeping Imogen anchored.

Imogen's face sours; she pays no mind to Maiselle's restraint or Sven's positioning near the door, her attention has narrowed to a singular focus that tunnels everything else into peripheral static. Her eyes lock onto his, then slide to Sven's face in calculated assessment.

"Do you not hear me—" she begins just as Sloane decides to speak,

*"Don't say anything."* Sloane's command echoes in his mind with sharp urgency as she pushes off the sofa, leaving his arm lukewarm and unoccupied; the sudden absence of her weight makes the cushions shift beneath him, *"I've only ever said horrible things about you to Imogen. It was my way of coping."*

*"Coping with what?"* he asks, though he already knows the answer. 

Sloane turns her head just enough to make eye contact with him before exposing him to the complex shame she feels, and the bond between them quivers with the force of her guilt.

*"The one thing that all three of us will never get over, Dain."*

Once she's just ahead of Imogen, Dain watches as she pulls her friend into a tight hug, tighter than he'd ever seen her embrace Avalynn. It makes him wonder just how close the two are. How long they've known each other. His eyes drop to his lap and he sighs, realizing that other men aren't the only things that will leave him scathingly jealous about her.

"Mo," Sloane's speech is a long exhale of breath that makes her shoulders drop while her arms wrap around Imogen, "aren't you supposed to be in Chakir?"

Imogen's right hand drops from her dagger, and her left hand wrenches free from Maiselle's grip, then she slowly returns Sloane's embrace. Never once do her eyes slip away from Dain's person.

"I was, but I caught wind of some gossip," she pulls away and kisses Sloane's cheek, "and if any of it is true I'm certain I could be more helpful here."

The tension in the room shifts subtly, and Dain feels an instance of exigency settle against his shoulders like a heavy blanket; it's Sven's gift. He can recognize the careful control of his gift in how the feeling doesn't invade but rather exists alongside everything else happening. Still, paying attention to the flier hadn't been a priority and the fact that Dain's mind makes it one is the only inkling that magic is being used on himself.

When he glances toward the door, Sven's already watching him, his expression neutral but focused. Dain remembers how the flier used to glare at him with open distrust, now there's only compassion and tenderness.

The feeling changes; it becomes more pointed: there's the sudden urge to listen, to pay attention to something beyond Imogen, to *Sven*. He lets his focus linger on Sloane a moment longer before facing Sven who's pushed the door shut and now stands in front of it, positioning himself between the suite and whoever might be gathering in the hallway beyond. The movement is purposeful, protective; Sven is actively managing the space, controlling access, ensuring whatever conversation happens here stays contained.

"Yes?" Dain murmurs to Sven, hushed under the sounds of Sloane and Imogen's discussion,

"I was coming to check on you after what that old man did during the meeting, but I see that you're fine."

He jerks his chin upward toward Sloane, then his eyes slide to Imogen, assessing her with the same careful calculation Dain sees during their patrols together, 

"Though I'm not sure the same can be said for your current company."

Dain nods, "It's all fine."

"You sure? I could kill him. He's not a representative anymore." Sven's voice is quiet, but there's no humor in it now; his attention is split between Dain and the room, watching Imogen's hand on her dagger, tracking Maiselle's grip, monitoring Sloane and Cat all the same.

"He's still one of King Tauri's advisors."

Sven clicks his tongue, "What a shame. We'll have to keep an eye out for him, not sure who he's aligned with after that theatre production he just gave—but it's obvious whomever it is doesn't want you straying any further from Navarre's grasp."

"Too late," Dain says it quietly, and Sven's expression softens just enough that Dain knows he understands, Sven's mouth opens to say something else and Dain feels Sloane's panic spike through their bond like a lightning strike. She's nearly shaking while pulling away from Imogen and his attention fractures; he's trying to listen to whatever Sven is about to tell him while simultaneously feeling Sloane's anxiety ratchet up, her emotions tumbling over each other in their pathway.

"Dain," Cat's voice cuts through his and Sven's conversation in a gleeful tone, "you might want to pay attention to this."

He shifts his attention back to Sloane and Imogen, who've also done the same and now watch him and Sven,

"I promise, you're overreacting," Sloane says, but her voice comes too fast, and Dain can feel through their bond that she's trying to be calm and measured; she wants to be steady, wants to handle this with grace, wants to approach Imogen with the same careful thoughtfulness she's shown in their conversations. Her arm raises and gestures to Dain, "But nothing is happening that I didn't ask for."

Imogen's brow creases, "What?"

*"You don't have to do this."* Dain reassures her through their bond, his voice soft, but he's aware of Cat watching him, aware of Sven still positioned at the door, aware that he's trying to manage too many things at once, *"I don't know what your relationship with Imogen is like but I don't want you—"*

Sloane's eyes snap to his, wide, panicked, *"She would never walk away from me because of someone else. Especially not someone I'm choosing."*

Her dissuasion amounts to nothing under the tension in their bond; Dain feels her discomfort, the impending disapproval she's gearing up for stabbing both of them at once.

He's not worth being chosen over someone already established in her life.

"We—"

Dain lifts off of the sofa, "Sloane, *stop.*"

He winces when his heart's harbor glances at him with her cerulean eyes glazed over, "I don't need you to make this decision for me. Sit."

His body collides back into the couch, and Sloane brushes against him in their pathway,

*"Good boy,"* she coos.

During the pause in Sloane's explanation, Maiselle's gaze drifts to Dain's throat again, her brow furrowing slightly before her eyes widen with realization. She looks at Sloane, then back at Dain's throat again before cocking her head to the side.

"Thoirt and Cath are bonded," Sloane announces, blinking when Sven casts a sound shield across the door.

The flier looks directly at Dain with a shocked expression and his inky black eyebrows lifted.

Sloane continues, "But before this happened Dain and I—"

"Sloane, do you have any fucking idea—" Imogen cuts in,

"Mo, *listen* to me!"

She straightens out her back and juts her chin out, head lifting to give Imogen an indignant glare.

She might as well have stomped her foot and pouted too, she's so damned cute.

"We kind of—"

Maiselle throws her arms and hands out facing Dain, "Your *neck,* it was Mairi?! Is that why she wasn't at muster?"

"What?" Dain groans before the memories of Maiselle asking about the hickeys on his neck smack into him so hard he nearly gets whiplash, "Maiselle... now is the wrong time."

"There's no way, you guys hate each other." Maiselle gawks, eyes bouncing from Sloane, then back to him, "And you're her Wingleader."

"Hate fucking someone is so much better than just hating someone. Isn't this such a comedic parallel of Sorrengail and Riorson at this point." Catriona purrs from the chaise.

The color fades away from Imogen's face and Sloane's panic booms so vividly in the bond, the braiding magic in their pathway separates into a fine mist,

"He's sleeping with you?" Imogen gasps.

Sloane shuffles next to Imogen, "Look he didn't proposition me or anything; I wanted it, *I* fucked *him.*"

"Oh. Kinky." Sven whistles.

Dain coughs, sputtering before words manage to form and ducking Sven's glittering eyes.

"Sloane, no—" he begins when Imogen's head snaps upwards, 

"What kind of odd Navarrian shit are you forcing her to partake in Aetos?" she hisses, shouting over them both, "I need you to get to talking now. Stop acting like you suddenly don't love running your mouth."

His eyes slide to Sloane before responding, as he watches Imogen cut Sloane off and demand explanations she had already been attempting to give. 

He sees it then, the pattern he knows too well because *he's lived it* from the other side; all those times Violet had tried to explain herself, when she'd tried to tell him something important, and he'd trampled right over her autonomy, inserted himself where he'd decided he was needed, made her decisions for her because he'd convinced himself he knew better.

He'd done it thinking he was protecting her, thinking he was helping, but he'd been stealing her voice, her agency, her right to speak for herself.

And now here's Imogen doing the exact same thing to Sloane; cutting her off, demanding answers, refusing to let Sloane explain on her own terms, treating her like she can't handle her own conversations, like she needs someone else to speak for her. The recognition is acidic, and he absolutely fucking hates it. He hates that he understands exactly what Sloane is feeling right now because he's the one who used to make Violet feel this way.

"Sloane is right next to you, but you're talking to me like she doesn't exist. If you want answers, ask the person who's actively trying to give them to you," he snaps, patience thinned and all but whittled away.

"Hey, I don't need you to tell me how to treat people. In fact you'd be the last person I'd ever—"

Maiselle grabs Imogen's shoulder, eyes rough and narrowed, "What are you talking to him like that for?"

Imogen's face is reddened, sharing the same warm contrasted color palette as her hair and her eyes pin him with an anger the same shade. Of course he knows it's earned, Dain knows exactly what's causing her to react this way.

Liam is gone and he can't bring him back.

Every time he's graced with the honor of holding Sloane, of being in her presence, of *seeing* her from afar, he'll remember what he ruined for her.

While he waits for Imogen's inevitable response to Maiselle his heart squeezes, bleeding into the bond and the ebbing pain from useless regret poisons the pathways. He drops his head and takes a gulping breath, grounding while he works up his shields; Sloane doesn't need to feel this.

Not when he knows she's feeling so much already.

*"Minnow."* 

Thoirt's voice finds its way through the stones he's begun to place; she's velvet and serene in his ears, tranquil and transparent in his mind. It surprises him to hear her, so much so that it shocks him out of grounding and his rising ramparts stutter at her reassurance. She's only using the pathway meant for herself and Dain,

*"Must you carry guilt that was never meant for you? Stop punishing yourself over a death you did not cause."*

His resolve crumbles before his shields can fully form; Thoirt's words penetrate a place untouched, and the pain suppressed floods through their connection so intensely that Sloane's head swivels toward him, her eyes wide with alarm.

*"Breathe, and let her in."*

Their eyes meet and the trembling begins.

They have the same eyes, the same grin, the same face.

Imogen's voice disrupts his thoughts, "He's the reason—"

*Gods,* all day today he's been hearing things he'd rather not: his surname, his father's name, what he can and can't achieve on his own. When Imogen responds to Maiselle, Catriona's surprise is obvious and plastered across her face. Maiselle bears concerned confusion, and Sven only keeps his eyes lingering on Dain. All of it is so slow to take in. It's deafened, smothered under waves of temperate water as Thoirt calms him.

He tries hard to reach for the thoughts pulling him under but Sloane's daggertail keeps him gated away from them,

*"We're safe here, Minnow. Just swim like you do with Cath. Like you always have."*

Sloane's eyes are on him as she shouts, near screaming, then they shutter to Imogen, and back to him—she's worrying.

She's worried about him.

Thoirt's presence expands in his mind before engulfing him entirely, her magic and emotions flooding through their shared pathway like water. Dain feels himself submerging into the sensation; it's warm and steady and he floats in the current of a lazy stream. He lets Thoirt guide him to steadier currents.

He can breathe again for a moment, can feel his thoughts slowing, it's only when the anxiety recedes enough for him to think clearly that he realizes she's built walls between their pathway and the one he shares with Sloane, shielding him from the chaos of Sloane's emotions so that his own panic doesn't flood back through and overwhelm her while she's trying to handle Imogen.

She's protecting them both, he realizes, giving Sloane space to focus while keeping him grounded, and the understanding makes his fucking eyes sting.

"*Stop* saying that!" Sloane's voice peaks and bends over them all, it's demanding and hoarse, clearly offended,

"Stop saying *anything* was his fault."

Imogen steps back, startled, Sven straightens against the door, and Maiselle blinks rapidly, dumbfounded at Sloane's sudden offense.

*"Breathe Minnow."* Thoirt commands.

Dain covers his mouth with his hand. Gasping. He does his best to cover it up but Sven and Catriona's eyes carve him out the same way they did weeks ago when he'd first started walking again.

Full of worry.

*"My Little Love is very capable of handling herself. See?"*

"Have you tried even once, on my behalf or Liam's, at getting Dain's side of the story?" she bites, stepping to Imogen with bright eyes,

"I don't need to, Liam is *dead* Sloane. That was the side he chose."

"Right." Sloane sighs,

Sloane turns around, walking back to Dain with her face flushed and scrunched, "Is that any different than Navarre deciding its citizens don't need to know about Venin? There's only one side to this that matters and that's how you perceived it? The one that leaves us in the right to treat him like shit for it all while asking for favors?"

*"Bathing chamber,"* she tells him before turning back to face Imogen, *"I need five minutes, I'll meet you in there."*

"I haven't asked him for anything." Imogen spits,

Sloane scoffs, arms crossed over her chest, "Well, you're about to, aren't you?"

Dain doesn't argue, he doesn't stop to answer Catriona and Sven's mutters of concern. He strides straight into the bathing chamber and drops to his knees after hearing the door click shut, listening only to Thoirt's rumbling growls.

---

When Sloane enters the bathing chamber she's swift in reaching for him, and she's early. Five minutes feel more like ten, but he's certain it's only been three because he's counted them while swimming with Thoirt.

"What's wrong? What's happening?" she begins, grabbing his jaw and lifting up, forcing him to look at her, "Are you crying?"

Dain grits his teeth and crams his eyes shut—he breathes in through his nose, and slowly out of his mouth.

He can't tell her that every time he sees her, he sees her brother. When he sees Violet or Riorson he *relives* that moment in the courtyard when he discovered his father betrayed him. That Dain trusted him like a fool, hoping he'd do the right thing to protect Violet because she was the closest thing he'd ever have to a daughter.

Dain can't tell her he feels pathetic and worthless and undeserving of her affection and attention. He can't tell her that for the rest of his life he'll look at her and feel the same regret and tragic sadness that he does in love and happiness. He'll always be trapped in the complex webbing of what he caused regardless of never intending for it to happen. That if he had just left Violet alone, if he had never told himself he was in love with her, if he had respected her decisions and space, that he wouldn't ever have been the ultimate accessory to Liam's death. The cause of it all.

The words catch mostly in his throat but he manages to open his eyes and meet hers.

"I can't make the same mistake again," Dain groans, blinking away tears, "I've already hurt someone loving them. I can't do this again. I hurt you before I'd even known you, Sloane."

He pulls away from her to wipe his eyes with his palms.

"I can't make this go away and we can't pretend it never happened."

Sloane falls to her knees just ahead of him, the godsdamned woman, she grabs his face again and kisses him,

"Who's trying to run from it?"

"*I* am," he stammers, "I am. I'm ashamed of myself. Of who I was, that I can't mitigate, or repair the damage I've done. I was completely blind, a perfect damn pawn for them. I've hurt so many people and I can't help them heal. I don't know what to do—"

"Well first, you could breathe." She giggles but her eyes are glazing over, "Seriously, your face is red, Dain; do you need a kiss?"

His head rocks side-to-side; who in their right mind is denying Sloane Mairi a kiss?

Dain sits up on his knees, just enough to press his mouth into hers from beneath her.

Like this is fine: groveling, pathetic, defeated underneath her. He'd never wanted saving or death, maybe to escape, but both he wished for at Sloane's hand, and this was close enough to being saved.

"Better?"

Dain nods.

"You looked like you were going to throw up."

He snorts, "It dawned on me that everyone didn't know about everything that happened in Athebyne, that those deaths were—"

His voice catches on the word, and he can feel himself about to spiral into the same self-destructive pattern he's been fighting all day.

"Don't," Sloane hisses, eyes blazing blue, "Don't you fucking dare."

He takes a breath, and when he speaks again his voice is quieter, more controlled.

"I just... I was standing there listening to it being said aloud and the fact that Imogen knew you both, that you were all probably childhood friends."

His eyes drift to her face, and for a moment he sees it again—Liam's features in hers, the same eyes, the same grin, the same face that had haunted him earlier, "That you being that close to me caused such a visceral reaction in her. It reminded me of what I see every time I look at you."

His eyes stick to the braids crawling across the crown of her head to where they end just beneath her shoulder blades.

"It just reminded me that I have no fucking right to want you the way I do."

Sloane's eyes search around his lap, then find him again.

"I don't think there's anything that I can say to help you lessen the burden of guilt, Dain. But, I forgive you. For that part you think you played. We can talk about it more tonight if you want, you can tell me everything that happened from start to finish. If that's what it takes to help you live with yourself, it's a conversation we'll have to have."

Forgiven.

Her declaration doesn't make him feel any less guilty, or regretful, or pathetic; he wishes it would, that her forgiveness could lift the weight from his shoulders, but it only makes him feel heavier. Now he has to live with the knowledge that she's forgiven him for something he can't even forgive himself for.

"It can't help, nothing I explain, no amount of elucidation is going to make you any less alone than you are."

"Is that what this is about? Being alone? Because I'm not alone."

She kisses him.

"I have Thoirt."

She kisses him again, "And Avalynn," and again, "And Aaric," and then again, "And Baylor," and yet again, "And Kai," and *again,* "and Violet, and Imogen."

He returns each one, full-mouthed, wet, flirty, and with each one his head is cradled in her warm hands.

"I have every marked one I'll ever come across. Every friend I've yet to make."

She runs her thumb across his bottom lip,

"I have *you.*"

His voice cracks while the words drop out of his mouth, "I'm not the right one Sloane."

"You don't need to be right or wrong Dain," she assures him, "you just need to be you."

---

When they re-emerge from the bathing chamber there's knocking at the suite door and Dain moves to answer it.

*"It's Second Squad, the third and second years."* Sloane informs him.

She drops onto the sofa next to Imogen, leaning onto the older woman in a way that makes him want to wedge himself between the two,

*"I have a feeling today is the day Fourth Wing drops in to check on you."*

He peeks back at Sloane, then to Maiselle; sVEN AN
