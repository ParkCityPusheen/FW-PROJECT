Their graduation ceremony is the longest, most insignificant event in Sloane’s time as a first year yet. Of all the trials and tribulations she and the rest of Iron Squad had faced this year, graduation simply served as a buffer between themselves and where they all really wanted to be.

They all deserve the relief. The ceremony. The applause. Maybe some of them need it more than they realize and maybe she does too. But it doesn’t feel like pride in her chest—it feels like pressure.

She's not sure what to truly feel and how much of it to embrace.

Relief? Confidence? Something like joy?

She’s sure they’re all just overflowing with pride in themselves and each other, in the things they’d achieved, in what they learned and what they survived. It was no simple feat to conquer your first year at Basgiath after all, this was a war college, and they were definitely *at war.*

The speeches drone on for some time, and the crowd shifts restlessly as Sloane lingers at the edges—not out of spite, or anger, or even fear, but because she simply can’t bring herself to feel what everyone else seems to. This moment doesn’t feel like hers, not anymore—not after it was carved so cruelly from Dain’s hands. 

All she can think about is how many of them won’t be standing here next year, and how close he came to never standing again.

How thin survival stretches when you start to count on it.

Eventually, she ends up walking away from it all.

As she stands there in the flight field, leaning against Thoirt’s foreleg and watching the festivity happen in the courtyard below, she feels the burden of what’s to come again. She thinks about the absence of the fliers. Of Violet. Their shifting agendas—and her own.

Sloane’s become sensitive to invisible pieces moving around her; she isn’t sure what’s being planned, but she’s aware the gears are turning. Though, she smiles, she has plans of her own.

Still, some things don’t add up.

Why send Navarre’s head-honcho to oversee the happenings at Basgiath when there’s certainly more important things for him to be concerned with?

A breeze lifts the edge of her braid and her eyes pass over the Citadel, past the rider's quadrant and to the untouched administrative building.

Or *is* there anything more important than Basgiath?

King Tauri arrives at Basgiath with an ensemble of nobles and military officials that would’ve had Dain so stiff at attention he might’ve rang like a bell if someone touched him. General Melgren trails after Tauri like a stubborn shadow.

Sloane watches from the edge and senses a shift immediately; not in anything said aloud, but in the posture of guards and how many attend the ceremony. The way the officials never quite settle into the festivities, and how Melgren stoops like he’s dreading his entire life up to this point and the way he constantly checks for Codagh.

Something is wrong here—wrong in a way she doesn’t have the language for, only the gut-deep certainty that something’s been set in motion. And as she watches Melgren’s scowling face on the dais, she realizes it’s the perfect mirror of what she feels herself.

_”What if we left now?”_ the question lands heavier than Sloane expects and she closes her eyes and listens for Thoirt’s breath.

She passes a kernel of conjured escapism to Thoirt while leaning back against her entirely as the winds whistle against her scales. Sloane imagines Riorson House and the rolling valleys ahead of it, the cliffside it's burrowed into, and the mountains surrounding.

*”Then I suppose we would be gone. I have an idea of where you might want to be instead.”*

Her daggertail recalls the warmth of the hatching grounds there, and Sloane smiles.

*”Do you think they’re expecting us?”* she asks Thoirt,

*”Why don’t we find out?”*

---

The flight to Tyrrendor takes eighteen hours; she leaves navigation and everything else regarding it in Thoirt's judgement. While in the saddle, Sloane sleeps; they speak of Thoirt’s likes and dislikes, and of things that make them laugh or giggle. They make a few pit stops for bathroom breaks, though Thoirt doesn't need them, and to stretch.

Every time she bends to touch her toes, Thoirt flaps her wings hard enough to send her tumbling across the grass.

It’s close to one in the afternoon when she and Thoirt finally descend into Aretia, slipping beneath the last of the cloud cover, the city glowing faint beneath a velvet sky. Sloane’s body fizzes with warmth at the sight of green-tiled rooftops clustered between torchlit streets and the black cut of the mountains rising behind them. The peaks catch only the thinnest edge of moonlight—just enough to outline their jagged spines like sentries.

She never tires of seeing her home from the back of her dragon. From this height, the world looks orderly, tucked in and safe.

Her eyes catch movement near the center valley—another Red, and a rather large one at that.

*"Is that Cath?"* Sloane asks as they close in, her voice light with surprise.

*"It is."*

Cath moves casually to intercept their approach.

Thoirt circles once, before tipping her wings and coasting down in a smooth descent that barely disturbs the air. Their shadows skim across rooftops and cobbled alleys before sweeping into the fortress's courtyard.

She lands so close to Cath that his body only narrowly avoids brushing against Thoirt's extended wings. He lowers his head to hers in a rare display of familiarity, their horns tapping with a hollow echo that lingers in the courtyard. Sloane dismounts, boots hitting stone. She watches them a moment longer than necessary.

Too friendly, she thinks—it’s soft in contrast to the obliteration and rage she’d seen him unleash just two weeks ago. He looks completely healed: no trace of the bent wing he’d somehow flown with, and his eyes have returned to their glittering gold. She remembers them threaded with red and bursting veins, only faint cinders remain around his pupils, making the gold seem deeper now—almost marigold.

She's completely floored by the casual gentleness she's privileged to witness between the two Reds, “That seems a bit personal,” she mutters.

*“Nothing to see here,”* Thoirt coos, *“just a good dragon waiting for his dear friend.”*

Sloane narrows her eyes as the bond between them pulses—Thoirt nearly called Cath a _good boy._

*“Right,”* Sloane says aloud, brushing her hands against her thighs. *“Well, thank you for the ride, Thoirt. Tell Cath I said goodnight.”*

She doesn’t say it directly to him—Cath still scares the absolute shit out of her. She’d stay and admire dragon PDA longer, but she had her own horns she wanted to rub… if Dain was well enough, of course.

Cath doesn’t lower his head to her. His golden eyes track her every step as she heads for the stairs. Cold and observant.

*"Of course, Love,"* Thoirt bellows while Sloane climbs. *"Cath notes his bonded would be absolutely thrilled to see you."*

She stops mid-step, something primal tightening at the back of her neck. Slowly, cautiously, she glances back at Cath.

*“Did he actually say that?”*

*"No,"* Thoirt purrs. It’s not laughter. Not quite. But the satisfaction in her tone is unmistakable—Sloane just gave her exactly the reaction she wanted.

She’s clearly pleased with herself for tricking Sloane into locking eyes with fear’s reptilian embodiment.

And Cath?

He leans forward just a breath’s worth, enough to make her freeze. He isn't hostile, but certainly not welcoming either. A pulse runs down his tail like a twitch of warning, and Sloane needs no translation: _he does not like games._

She shivers, then forces a smile, addressing Dain’s dragon with something closer to survival than grace.

“Good evening, Cath.” 

*“He returns the greeting,”* Thoirt says, then hesitates. *“Though he asks*—_are you here for the flightleader?_”

Excitement rises before she’s ready for it, climbing so fast it scrapes against her ribs. It tangles in the soft and dangerous places beneath, in the guilt of wanting something so badly when he’s still recovering from what nearly destroyed him.

How do you approach someone who’s clawed their way back from the edge?

How do you reach for a person who might still be unraveling?

Dain survived what others would never foresee, what he maybe shouldn’t have, and she doesn't know how close he still is to that wreckage. She can’t barge into the aftermath just because she misses him. Naturally, her joy feels out of place beside wounds he might not know how to carry yet, let alone share.

She doesn't know if her presence will ease him or overwhelm. She only knows she wants to see him, to stand close enough to understand what has stayed and what’s shifted. She wants to offer herself honestly, without forcing her way in. But the part of her that aches for him isn’t the part that knows how to navigate grief this personal, this recent.

And underneath all of it, curled tight in the shadows of restraint, there’s still want. Not the warm, delicate kind, but the heavy, physical pull of being near someone her body hasn’t forgotten. It hums beneath her skin, hot and selfish.

She hopes to the gods Cath can’t sense it.

He already looks irritated enough, and she doubts he’d be thrilled to know the kinds of thoughts currently lurking behind her carefully neutral expression.

Sloane fidgets, shyly glancing up at Cath, “I'm headed to him now,”

Her face is probably as maroon as he is, and while the sweat she breaks into is cold, her face heats to its highest degree.

*"He is not in his den,"* Thoirt announces,

Sloane turns toward her, brow drawn, "Where is he?"

Cath lets out a sharp, gravelled grumble—unmistakably irritated, if the sharpness of its pitch is anything to go by.

*"He says not resting, nor recovering. He insists on helping the builders in the migrant villages.*"

The swordtail's body language transitions from unconcerned and hardly present, to unfathomably agitated and overprotective,

*"Cath requests you bring his hatchling home."* Thoirt says in a brave tone that mocks his posture.

And Sloane can't restrain the sputter of laughter that explodes from her throat as Cath turns to Thoirt with a look that could only mean _are you serious,_ delivered in the full, scathing majesty of a dragon who is deeply unimpressed.

---

Dain looks like a different man.

He wears his curls long now, parted cleanly down the left side—but everything else about them is chaos. They bounce by his lashes and skim the bridge of his nose, moving like they’ve always been this free.

He helps some fliers along the scaffolding above him, lifting buckets of cement to those who need it with lesser magic, six or two at a time. He seems unbothered, as a supervisor would, but the sweat that turns his ivory, high collared blouse nearly beige says otherwise.

Suddenly she feels like she might need to shove his head into a rucksack. Just to undo what a fucking haircut has done to her brain.

It’s undignified.

His close cropped curls in remembrance are a sad injustice compared to his new, particularly faddish (for him) cut, and Gods, the color in this light—it’s warmer. Sharper. As if he’s been kissed by the sun and she’s just catching up to it. His beard is trimmed close to his skin and the stubbled shade that it paints across his jawline makes him seem more wild than studious.

He’s got on a pair of trousers that are loose and hanging, and they stay expertly in place due to the cross back suspenders that crawl across his shoulders, chest, and abdomen. They cling in all the ways her gaze shouldn’t. His shirt is soaked through in places, fitted flush, revealing more and the way it screams against his pecs, even with the first few buttons undone is downright diabolical. She doesn’t mean to stare. But no one can see her salivating over him at the side of the building’s entrance, and this view is hers for the taking.

His cheeks stretch when he grins, eyes crinkling at the corners. He grimaces through the work, shoulders stiff, but he still laughs, still smiles as if it costs him nothing. Like he’s completely recovered mentally and physically from the ordeal at Basgiath. She can tell his movements are limited, and the flier who works beneath the scaffolding alongside him chastises him when he takes on too much.

He ignores her concern with a quiet word and a tilt of that stupid, beautiful grin.

Sloane is swept away in his reassurance to her, in those rippling muscles, and that *mouth*.

Sweat drops over his full lips. His tongue flicks out to catch it, dragging salted moisture slowly across the curve of his mouth—and just like that, she’s transported back to his bed.

Waking up with him between her legs, indulgent and insatiable—ignoring his own arousal just to watch her unravel. The click of his tongue. The furrow in his brow. All because she hadn’t let him drown in her.

*“I thought you hated loitering.”* Thoirt’s tone isn’t as overbearing as the nosy curiosity padding through their bond; it flickers, amused, and she watches it glitter from the quiet den of her mind.

*“I’m not loitering. I’m observing.”* she corrects her Red with a dismissive chortle,

*“Ah. And how long does observation last, usually?”*

Smartass.

Sloane grins.

*“Until he gets tired and is ready to head back to Riorson House."*

*“So you’ll ambush him instead of saying hello like a normal human?”*

Sloane crosses her arms, *"And what do you know about normal human interactions?"*

*"Enough to know ogling from afar is not normal."*

*"You say this as if observation is a crime."*

*"I would more readily call what you're doing admiration,"* Thoirt snorts, *"and you and I are ones meant to be admired, show him you are there. He will undoubtedly be stunned."*

*“I’m not seducing anyone, I'm supposed to be retrieving him. And, I’m dignified.”* Sloane chides, pulling her braid over her shoulder,

*“You’re hiding behind a wall.”*

*“Which is incredibly dignified, thank you.”*

The idea of prancing into a working zone full of officers and well-to-do civilians without purpose or principle would come off as reckless and desperate—and while she was both when it came to Dain, it would ruin her newfound reputation for being anything but.

She'd rather wait out what's clearly come to end, then she'd reveal herself after they'd all dispersed.

Sloane covers her mouth with a hand and smiles.

They hadn’t quite had the chance to know each other outside of anything that resembled courting—she remembers his dream of owning land, of building a home. His mention of fishing. Maybe she should suggest it. Fishing. What better way to learn someone than to be welcomed into the thing they love most?

"Dain we've finished the foundation and ground floor for this place in one day—this is a good stopping point."

Sloane twists against the wall and peaks past the corner to see Dain wiping away sweat from his forehead.

He runs a hand through his damp hair and the weight of his fingers pulls the curls loose, setting them into soft, open spirals that cling to nothing. His bangs stay only for a moment against his hairline before his eyes strays slide loose and unkempt against his skin once more.

She bites her bottom lip, because how is a sweat slicked side-part ruining her life right now?

Dain takes his massive hands and rubs over his shoulders before rolling his neck and groaning, then turns to the flier who called their work to an end. He stops casting, and the buckets lifted to workers and fliers along the scaffolding drop to the floor in unison—gentle thuds echoing through the stone bones of the building, still only partially finished.

Nestled at the base of the southern mountain span, the building rises in clean lines and warm tones—a blend of Tyrrish solidity and Poromish patterning, with tiled floors already inlaid and high windows framed in delicate latticework. It’s meant to welcome, not impress and to rest, not dazzle.

Dain looks whole here.

Stable, laughing, smiling and still standing. It's disarming in a way she didn’t expect.

Maybe it’s because there’s no Citadel in sight. No stone halls whispering of broken legacies. No uniformed cadets glancing sideways at his last name. No reminders of what his father did or what was broken in the wake of it. Maybe it’s easier to carry the weight of survival when no one’s looking at you like they expect to see cracks.

And maybe that’s why she suddenly feels too sharp in her formal blacks, all tailored lines and polished buttons—like a walking echo of everything he’s trying to build away from.

The thought lands heavily. What if just being here, like this, pulls him backward?

What if he sees her and remembers?

She wants to call out, to remind him she came for _him,_ not for what happened. But the timing suddenly feels fragile. Like stepping too close might shake something loose.

Still, the sight of him all sweat-soaked and golden in the mountain light, smiling like he doesn’t owe anything to the past, draws her forward anyway.

“Yeah, I think this is good.” His voice rumbles over her when he responds to whoever spoke to him, and that gentle Navarrian edge in his common tongue makes her smile.

"I think we could have this whole place built in like a week if we keep it up." the flier says to him.

She pulls her braided hair into a top bun and leans back against the scaffolding, content to stay still. Below her, Dain turns toward a flier with blonde hair and a patchy scruff. She recognizes him—Lieutenant Colonel Kingston.

The room quiets completely when the Lieutenant Colonel addresses Dain.

"Will you be helping the rest of the week?" he asks Dain with a bushy brow raised high.

"I don't plan on changing my schedule much—I don't really have much to do currently."

Someone snickers, "Do you mean Cath won't let you change it much?"

Dain chuckles, "That too."

"Alright!" Kingston belts out, "Pack everything up, no tools, no compound, and nothing breakable should be left on any place high up."

“Let’s keep this place neat. Trissa, Kiondra, and Felix are weaving runes and wards tomorrow, and I’d rather not make their jobs harder than they already are." Dain adds, before pulling on a pair of thick leather gloves,

*"That's your cue."* Thorit hisses, 

Sloane edges forward as the building exhales its contents. The wide stone entrance spills light and voices, three dozen riders, fliers, and staff surging out in loose clusters, the aftermath of labor and camaraderie. They roll the sleeves of the identical ivory blouses they all wear and share waterskins. She stays just out of the glow, but close enough to see Dain moving somewhere in the swell. The atmosphere is electric with the satisfaction of work well done, with exhaustion disguised as momentum.

The sound of beating wings in the near distance rattles her focus for a moment,

*"Cath?"*

Thoirt offers a draconic chuckle.

*"Cath."*

She cranes slightly, brows drawing together. Cath passes in a low, deliberate arc wit his wings stretched wide, casting a long shadow over top of them. But Dain’s walking the other way, swallowed by the current of his unit.

Cath had said bring him home. Not _meet him_ or _check in_—_bring._ As if Dain wouldn’t make the decision himself, like he needed the coaxing.

So why send Thoirt with her at all?

Dain is somewhere in the middle of the mob when she hears his voice before she catches him—it's *rasping*, unhurried, the same cadence he used when walking cadets through flight drills. He still isn’t walking toward Cath. In fact, Cath’s shadow sweeps farther, and Dain glances up but continues to move in the opposite direction.

The crowd is still a rolling tide, spilling across the gravel roadways without hurry, close-knit but lacking formation. Sloane watches as shoulders blur past, shaking with rising laughter, the clamor of tools passing through hands, and still Dain stays near the center of it all, just far enough to feel unreachable.

She doesn’t expect the hush when it comes. It begins near the front of the group a few steps from the tall figures she remembers from Basgiath, and then it unfurls into a shifting breeze. Their eyes find her, not all at once—somewhere in the center, a flier leans into another’s shoulder and mutters something. Two more pairs of eyes turn her way. A brow lifts, and another's mouth curves.

Dain hasn’t seen her. He gestures toward a stack of timber, the stretch of his shirt dragging over his shoulder blades, suspenders braced across his chest. He’s directing something and still folded inside whatever shape this day has asked of him when he pauses. It’s subtle, just the hesitation at the edge of movement—his hand stalls mid-gesture, his weight shifts faintly back into his heels. A breath later, he tips his head like something brushed against the nape of his neck.

He keeps his back to her, keeps speaking, but she sees the fault line. Feels it, almost. He knows she's there. She doesn’t know how, but he *does*.

When he turns, the recognition takes less than a heartbeat but it lingers like something unspoken between them. His body stills and his expression rearranges itself around her presence. His mouth parts for words, but he doesn't speak, just breathes in the shift of air between them.

Behind him, someone whistles low. Another voice murmurs something dry and shaped like approval. She doesn’t register it. The only gravity in her chest is Dain—and he’s already moving, slow as his acknowledgment,

“Second Lieutenant Aetos,” she says, her voice polished and lightless, an instrument of habit rather than affection. With her chin raised and eyes sharp, she meets his eyes and they're lacking any reservation or confliction.

He's at peace here, *safe,* and content,

"Sloane."

There’s no shield against his voice. 

The feeling of the weight in it, not from volume but from steadiness. Rich and quiet, it sinks into the hollows of her body and claims them again without permission. Her spine holds her proud and rigid in the face of his peers, but her breath forgets how to cycle through her lungs when some of Squadron skulks between them.

Sloane hears them before she sees them, and they're *close.*

“Ceremony’s north of here, sweetheart.” 

Her voice is sharp, velvet-dry and pitched just loud enough for others to catch. The woman is midnight skinned, stunning, with rows of braids crown-woven to perfection. She gives Sloane only a sidelong glance as she passes, “Unless you’re lost. Or late.”

Sloane doesn’t move as another figure fills the space between them. He’s massive—taller than any of them, even Xaden—and walks slow, like nothing in the world would move faster than he allowed. A toothpick hangs from his mouth like a second tongue and when he speaks it doesn’t shift,

“You come dressed to remind him what he missed?”

His voice scrapes low, sweetened only by the burn of whatever’s pressed between his teeth, he doesn’t look at her when he says it. He doesn’t need to; the fact that she’s still in her formal dress uniform, that her flight goggles hang conspicuously around her neck, and that she looks undeniably like someone who came here on impulse, not invitation, says all it needs to.

Someone snorts behind him and a rider brushes past without apology, shoulder grazing hers with too much intention to be casual.

She’s being closed in. Not physically, but the attention from them is enough. The sudden hush of conversation around Dain tells her exactly where the focus has shifted and it’s *not* on her arrival. It’s on what her arrival means for him, to *them*.

“That’s enough.”

It’s curt and final. Not loud—loudness would’ve lessened it. 

Dain speaks with casual exhaustion as he shrinks the distance between them with affirmative steps, and he waits for his unit's eyes to claim his before continuing,

"I don’t expect to hear another word unless you’re offering water or an apology.”

Sloane doesn’t breathe until the tall one backs off first, toothpick disappearing behind his teeth as he glances toward Dain and nods once. The woman with the braids steps back half a pace, unreadable, but respectful. He offers neither explanation nor farewell to them, just reaches out—gloved fingers brushing gently at Sloane’s elbow, and begins to walk with a slight limp.

“Mirka’s protective. Sven’s worse.” he offers once they're out of the earshot of the working party,

Sloane says nothing at first. The tightness in her chest has not fully loosened.

“You didn’t need to say anything,” she murmurs finally.

“No—I did.”

His hand lingers. And she lets it.

---

He leads them back to Thoirt and Cath, but Dain makes no move to mount, instead he watches her with fascinated eyes and a thin smile.

"Everything okay?" She wonders aloud as she presses her fingers against Thoirt's scales.

She’d meant to take off with him, now that his peers had stopped flaying her with silent judgments, but he seems as if he has his own plans,

“I just—” He rakes both hands through his curls, loosening them into wider, defiant half spirals—every ringlet a rebellion. It doesn’t help her focus when he looks like Amari would’ve sculpted him by hand and then bragged about it for centuries.

Dain stands straighter, distributing his weight evenly across his hips as if he still isn't injured, "Congratulations, by the way. First year is the toughest to survive."

Sloane drops her hands and turns to face him entirely. She could make a joke about him nearly dying as a third year—but it spoils on her tongue, curdling in her chest before it reaches her throat. She wouldn't allow another to joke at him about what transpired between himself and his father, so she'd be damned if she did it herself,

"Solstice starts tomorrow. I just left early. And you didn't miss anything, trust me."

"Well, that's good to hear, I suppose." He grunts and shifts his weight, the effort subtle but not entirely smooth.

"Thank you, also."

They linger there, caught in the strange silence that always seems to stretch between people who care more than they know how to say. Her fingers twitch like they might do something if she let them, but she doesn’t move.

"I was worried about you." she hates the desperate way it launches out of her throat—too sudden, and loud, but it’s true.

"I missed you," she adds, gentler.

He looks at her like he expected her to come, or at least like her presence doesn’t throw him off the way she’d imagined it might. His expression holds steady, calm enough to make her feel ridiculous for thinking he’d crumble on sight. A part of her had wanted to knock the wind out of him—just a little. She thought maybe he'd be stunned or rattled, even just momentarily shaken. But instead, he seems centered. Present. Clear-eyed.

She should be relieved. She _is_ relieved. Still, the part of her that hoped for chaos aches a little at how easily he tailors her into the moment without being undone by it.

Very *wingleader-y* of him in the presence of his peers.

He chuckles low, but there's no ease in it, and his hand drifts to the back of his neck, then drops again,

"Turns out Malek's not interested. I'm still breathing. And yours, if you’ll have me."

He says it so plainly, like he's confirming the weather, like it costs him *nothing* to offer her everything. 

Something soft and stupid unfolds in her chest, as unbidden as it is undeniable. It crochets between her ribs like it’s been waiting all year, patient and smug, and now it’s pulling them together tight with the kind of girlish joy she’d have mocked herself for once—if it didn’t feel so devastatingly real. 

Of course he’s calm. Of course _she’s_ the one falling apart.

He’s still dirty from the work site, hair damp and clothes creased, voice low and weighted. She, in contrast, stands in crisp formalwear, her posture intact but brittle, unraveling quietly from the inside out beneath the lingering exhaustion of an eighteen-hour flight.

He means it, she can feel that. And it floors her.

She doesn't know how to answer, not immediately. Not without sounding like she might cry or kiss him or do both at once.

"I _do,_ but I want us properly," her voice trembling as she folds all the fear she carried for him into the space between them, "Since our lives seem determined to be a chain of near-death experiences and statistical miracles... I want to spend what's left with you while I can."

Dain doesn't blush, or blink, or even *breathe.*

“Then a date,” he says, voice rough, like it’s caught in his throat, then he steps closer and tips his head to meet her eyes, “You and me. Now.”

She doesn’t move, but her pulse jumps hard enough that she swears he can hear it.

Or maybe he’s just looking at her like he already knows.

"Like this?" she stammers. "Me—like *this?* We should change, shower. Maybe not smell like dirt, dragons, and exhaustion? I’ve flown for eighteen hours straight and I hate this formal uniform."

He seems like his patience snaps and she watches his pupils dilate,

"I will strip naked and crawl next to you if that's what it takes Sloane, just tell me what you want."

She exhales through a laugh, lightheaded and grounded all at once, “You wouldn’t actually crawl. And definitely not naked.”

“I would drag my broken, naked self right through the Great Hall for you,” he replies flatly, “but I’d _rather_ get cleaned up first.”

“Then let’s do that. I don't think indecent exposure would be a good look for your unit.”

Dain's eyes flick to Cath, then back to her, "No, it wouldn't."

They take the last few strides need to reach their dragons and as Sloane reaches to feel the sun warmed scales of Thoirt's foreleg, Cath rears back,

"I wouldn't be against you crawling for me though," she admits while watching the two of them.

He responds suggestively while reaching for Cath, standing between the swordtail's talons, "I'd need incentive."

Cath takes a momentous step backward and lifts his head at a wounded angle, eyes narrowing on Dain—and as the brunette steps toward him, Cath _screams_ directly in his face. The sound blasts through the clearing, sending Sloane’s hair flying; she manages to shield her ears for most of it, but still winces at the sheer volume. Dain, however, doesn't flinch. He just stands there, unmoved and unbothered, like this has happened before. Repeatedly.

He slowly wipes his cheek with the back of his hand, gaze fixed flatly on his dragon. 

“You done?” he asks Cath, in a tone so dry and resigned that Sloane nearly laughs. 

There’s nothing adversarial in their standoff—it’s petty, almost juvenile, friendly antagonism bred from years of mutual irritation and zero boundaries.

When Dain turns back to her, he’s blushing slightly, and his side part has collapsed into a perfectly noble middle break, he sweeps strands now framing his face so perfectly it looks deliberate—impossibly, unfairly deliberate.

What the *fuck* is this haircut?!

"I'm still on Brennan's flight ban so I'll walk back with everyone and meet you there?" his eyes search her face as he speaks, while ignoring Cath entirely, "I'm on the second floor, in the familial quarter—the room after Bohdi's and across from Brennan's."

"Oh?" her smiles falters when Bohdi's name flashes through her mind as quickly as his name falls into her ears, "Part of the family now?"

Dain chuckles and shrugs, "Brennan needed me close so he could sleep in peace; I'm sure Riorson kicks me out when he gets back though. Too bad because I really like it."

"Wouldn't doubt it." Sloane laughs, it's honest and she can picture what he dreads happening so plainly on his face,

"Alright Sloane, just give me a few, probably more then an hour or two—to shower after I get back." he waves, glares at Cath, and smiles so brightly she nearly tips backwards into Thoirt.

She watches him walk away.

His gait is steady, though there’s still that subtle favoring of one leg. He blends easily into the loose crowd dispersed ahead of the building, already half-draped in scaffolding and bright, evening sunlight. A few members of his unit fall into step around him, casual and unhurried, and the laughter that ripples ahead of them is easy coming and relaxed.

He belongs there.

Sloane presses her palm to Thoirt’s side, more to center herself than anything else. The dragon shifts just slightly beneath her touch, offering quiet support. She climbs, fingers hooking into the slight grooves between scales, her knee lifting as she pulls herself up along Thoirt’s shoulder.

As she rises, her eyes follow Dain one last time—he pauses at the edge of the finished foundation, hand lifted in some small gesture to someone inside, his back turned. And before him the tree line they'd walked through.

But something tugs at the edge of her awareness there.

They’re not obvious. Not even out of place at first glance, they're just a light smudge along the green, a shade that doesn’t reflect the light of the hour. Then another. And another. Her gaze tracks the tree line as she counts them and their gryphons. 

*His fliers*. 

Woven into the foliage. Not clumped or scattered, but _staggered_—layered with precision. A flier crouched beneath a broad pine limb, another perched where the light shifts amber, their bodies half-swallowed by green. Some higher, some near ground level, but all of them still.

And all seven of them and their feathered bonds watching her. Not the building. Not Dain.

_Her._

Sloane slows her climb, one hand firm on Thoirt’s shoulder, the other settling lightly at the base of her neck. Her gaze lingers on the fliers and she recognizes the two who acknowledged her: the dark-skinned woman near the rear, and the tall man who had spoken *at* her earlier, now flanking the far right edge of the line.

Her eyes narrow. She shifts slightly, just enough to glance back over her shoulder—past Thoirt’s spine, past the thinning trees—to where Cath sits like a monument.

Tucked between two massive pine trunks, barely ten strides from his tail, is a gryphon. Black as onyx and ink, notably smaller than Cath and even Thoirt, but massive enough to bend the tree it rests against and easily the biggest she's ever seen of it's kind. Its feathers catch no light, drinking the dim instead, and its black eyes fix on her with a kind of focus that makes her skin crawl.

“Thoirt,” she says through her teeth.

*“Oh, we see them,”* her dragon hums, deep and entertained as if nothing about this moment is new.

Cath shifts behind her, he makes a low, guttural sound—not quite a growl, not quite a hiss. 

Just a rumble that seems to say she’s the only one surprised.
