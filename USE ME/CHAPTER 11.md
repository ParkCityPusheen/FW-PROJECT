### [Chapter 11](https://archiveofourown.org/works/63478354/chapters/167545276): Sloane | Betrayal

Avalynn watches Dain with unbridled interest as he files past Cat and Maren straight to Maiselle, his executive officer. They're huddled together closely to get their conversation as private as they can. When some of the cadets from First Wing shuffle near them as they wait their turn to mount, Dain's eyes narrow and he casts an oddly shaped spell shield around them.

"I thought he sucked at runes," Avalynn mutters,

Sloane raises a brow, "He does."

"So tell me again. You guys have been training, and talking? Like talking-talking."

"He's interested in me."

Avalynn scoffs and points at him, "You probably got him some sort of infraction because you've refused to wield in like all of our classes,"

Sloane frowns, repeating her previous statement more gravely, "He's interested in _me_."

"Your _wingleader_?" she laughs and slaps Sloane on the shoulder, "Okay."

"He told me." Sloane admits,

Her gut knots as Avalynn processes the information.

"And you're telling me this, obviously, because you're considering it?"

She scratches her chin before continuing, "You aren't the type to play with your food so..."

"No, I did that too."

Avalynn leans towards her with slitted eyes, "How exactly?"

The many nights of her occupying space in their wingleader's bed passes from her mouth to Avalynn's ears and Sloane's body tightens with each admission.

"I should laugh." the redhead mutters, moving forward in the line closer to Dain and Maiselle, "I really should."

"Why aren't you?"

"Because he's hot? And dependable." Avalynn thinks for just a moment longer, "And he's been different since Draithus."

Sloane glances at him from where they stand and peeks up at Cath hovering above him like a sentry, "It's like he killed whoever he was before."

"Maybe he experienced ego-death?" then she thoughtfully mentions: "Also I think the two of you are more similar than you think."

They're the next two up for dismount reenactments and Sloane watches as her Red and Avalynn's Orange shuffle towards them.

"And how is that?" Sloane asks mildly,

Avalynn shrugs, "Well, you were both left out of the loop by your closest friends—I mean, if he and Sorrengail's posse ever were friends. It's hard to tell. You know, I've seen him walk right past her without saying anything to her besides a greeting recently."

"Why are you so unbothered by this news?" Sloane gripes, stepping up to Thoirt,

"Why are you so bothered by it?"

"Why wouldn't I be?"

Sloane's blood boiled inside of her. No one seemed to care that what transpired with her brother was as bad as she felt it was.

"Riorson and Sorrengail got together and they were fine." Avalynn winces, "I mean, like, their relationship?"

"But it's Dain Aetos and myself not Xaden and Sorrengail."

"So? The only problem you can even reach for is what happened with your brother, and please don't take what I'm saying out of proportion, but he didn't plan that. Considering he split Basgiath right down the middle of his own free will says a lot about what could've been if he had been properly informed."

Sloane is quiet.

"I mean, maybe you could've helped Riorson if you had know what was going on. We don't know, do we?"

Sloane's mount is quick, her and Thoirt's flight is silent, and her rolling dismount is flawless.

Her logic though?

Riddled with holes.

She saunters behind Avalynn back to where Lynx and Baylor sit at the edge of the valley, watching the rest of their Wing preform.

She isn't sure when hating Dain's existence became her way of honoring her brother's, but it had and in light of his treatment of her it was now a sticky, burning substance at the bottom of her heart. Liam had no issues with Dain; he appreciated the way he worried for Violet the way he worried for Xaden, though it was excessive. If he were here now he would surely develop a fondness of Dain in his treatment of Sloane, in the encouragement of her growth—but he wasn't here. He wasn't here and she couldn't be sure.

She bites her thumb and leans back against Avalynn and watches Dain and Maiselle takeoff further up the valley, launching back to Riorson house after speaking with the instructor.

It's only one thing, and her biggest thing, that stops her from accepting him.

It's loyalty.

"Maybe you should get a third opinion?" Avalynn suggests, "From someone outside of our Wing, tell them everything, let them gauge it."

"Gauge what?" Lynx yawns, "I can be a third opinion."

"Mind your business." Avalynn retorts, then cranes her head down to Sloane when she lays head across Avalynn's lap, "You're hitting the sparring chamber with Kavanagh tonight right? Talk to him about it, he seems pretty straight-laced too."

---

"Looking for someone?"

Imogen's voice is hardly a whisper and she's leaned forward to speak against the shell of Sloane's ear, "He missed lunch because they were training their magic."

Sloane glances back at Imogen and follows her line of sight to Dain and Cat seated next to each other farther down the theatre and across from them,

"I don't remember asking for that information." Sloane grumbles, "But thank you."

"You've been watching him like a hawk the whole class basically; scared she'll steal your tutor?"

Her green eyes dig into Sloane like dragon talons. There's something there behind that bored, inquisitive stare she fixes on the blonde, but Sloane can't make out what it is. She's glad Imogen thinks Cat is stealing away her teacher and not a plausible romantic interest. This also isn't the first time she's caught Sloane staring, specifically at Dain.

"What if I am?" Sloane admits, rubbing her arm,

Imogen raises a brow, "Tell him to stop trying to be everywhere at once for starters; because you need him in shape for training."

"What do you mean by that?"

"He's been sleeping probably a total of four hours a day, avoiding Violet, training his signet with Cat, working with the assembly and Poromiel for the tandem unit. He's been staying on top of his wingleader duties, too. Our Wing was the first to have our reports graded and turned in."

Sloane sighs inwardly; she knows the flight time he's been putting in towards training the tandem unit has kept him perpetually out of class and exhausted. His skin is several shades darker than it usually is, even more so than when he was island hopping with Quest Squad. She watches him from across the theatre; he's sunk into his seat with his legs spread wide, cheek resting against his fist. His head nearly rests on Cat—who doesn't shy away from the contact anymore. In fact, she looks over at him breathing steadily, whispering something that makes him sit up after stretching his legs, he turns his head to respond to her, and at this angle it almost seems like they share a fucking kiss.

She rips her eyes from them and focuses entirely on Imogen,

"He's been getting sent on patrol a lot too." Sloane adds,

"Yup," Imogen leans back into her seat and Sloane turns around halfway to maintain their conversation, "Third years are definitely getting first hand experience right now."

"You sound worried." She says to Imogen,

"I am."

"About him?" Sloane adds,

"Yeah." Imogen tilts her head and shrugs, "He's a good guy, just impulsive sometimes."

"Do you think training with Cat is actually helping him?"

"Probably," she chews the inside of her cheek, "Mind-work signets like ours are hard to gauge without consistent training."

She turns around, focusing entirely on the lecture as the minutes pass by like years. Well, she _tries._

"Can I ask you something," she begins to Imogen as they spill out of the theatre,

"Of course."

"How did you manage to trust Sorrengail knowing what she was capable of?"

Imogen stops just ahead of the theatre, leaning against the stone walls and out of the way of the flood of cadets around them. She looks down at her feet in thought and her pink hair tumbles over her nose,

"It was a lot, especially at first. It's easy to hate someone by proxy," she laces her hands together and looks over at Sloane, "but Violet wasn't her mom, and never acted like her. Sure there were moments that had us all terrified, but in every moment she needed to prove us wrong, she did. By nature, we should hate her, but nothing is ever that simple,"

Sloane leans against the wall next to her.

Dain isn't his dad, and never acted like him either.

_"You don't need a reason to consider him outside of simply wanting to."_ Thoirt suggests, 

_"I do, in order to not feel guilty about it."_

"Trust me," Imogen grits, "you'll know the moment someone has ill-intentions towards you. He and Violet might've taken a while to feel out, but they've shown us who they are."

---

Sloane bites away the last bit of her pinky nail as she waits for Kavanagh to make his appearance; she's early, and usually is because Dain had once suggested to her: _if you aren't fifteen minutes early, you're fifteen minutes late,_ when she'd first arrived at Basgiath.

A sound of discontent escapes it's prison from deep within her throat as she organizes her thesis, thoughts, and concerns for Kavanagh to dissect. The First Wing rider had sharp features and even sharper senses. He was endlessly critical of the way she moved around him on the mat and he never offered a smile or reassurance, just impatient and logical correction. Honestly, he was the perfect person for a mental realignment, she thinks, and she had to need it considering all of the exceptions she was willing to make about her wingleader.

"So consumed in thought you don't even notice me walk in?" Kavanagh's nasally voice streaks through her stream of consciousness with blearing indifference, "There are so many moments I could've killed you Mairi."

Sloane rolls her eyes, "Think you would've by now if you wanted to." she jeers,

"You never know," he whistles,

Something in the air shifts when their eyes meet but Sloane shakes it away; she's there to have herself psychoanalyzed, not to do it to Kavanagh.

"I want your opinion on something."

"Oh?" he cocks a brunette brow, "It'll be pure judgement. Do continue."

_Prick._

She explains Liam, Violet, Xaden, and Dain to him. Lays out her reservations, exploits her _hypothetical_ feelings that she may or may not have for him, and the shame that folds around her when she embraces them. Sloane describes the lengths he goes for her in her readiness and wielding, and how no one else is willing. How no one else has even _tried_. She makes sure he knows that she figures she can trust him based on the consensus that he split the quadrant and also was the only rider to openly employ the assistance of another marked one in a position of leadership since Xaden and his entourage had graduated, _or_ disappeared.

She digests his body language as she speaks and finds she doesn't like it, realizes she doesn't care for it.

"Maybe it's because your a woman that the emotions have turned into something they're not."

Sloane's shoulders dip, "What does _that_ mean?"

She can't... discern what the weird indifference he displays is. It wasn't any different from his usual slimy dickheadedness on the surface, but something felt more impersonal. _I__f_ they could be anymore.

"I would've killed him if I were you. The same way he killed your brother." Kavanagh circles her with his arms crossed as he wraps his hands, preparing for their session, "I think you're misreading everything, horribly."

"Oh, am I?" she snaps, snatching the roll of stretchy wrap from his hand when he extends it to her,

"Obviously. Even now he works more with the Poromish than he does Navarre."

Sloan gawks at him, rolling her twin braids into heavy buns that brush against her shoulders, "What does that have to do with anything that I just said, Kavanagh?"

He grabs the heavy notch that sits between his face and the slope of his nose, sighing.

"He is one-hundred percent responsible for your brother's death, and because he's giving you the time of day you're trying to twist his intentions into something it's not because you're _lonely_ and feel sorry for him?"

"I never said I was fucking lonely." She heaves, lancing the words at him like acid, "What's your fucking issue?"

Kavanagh laughs, "Me? I'm not the one lusting over my fucking wingleader who killed my last living relative."

"He didn't kill Liam." She snarls, Sloane keeps her tone low and even, and that feeling in the air from earlier settles around her like finely grated flint—Kavanagh was certainly ready to ignite, but over what?

"You're right. He got him killed—oh, but he's still dead either way. Surprise!"

Sloane squares her shoulders and bends her right arm at the elbow, drawing back and untucking her thumb from her clenched fist. She extends her arm out fully and feels her nerves settles momentarily when her fist connects with Kavanagh's face, she can breathe again when she feels the crunch of his humped nose against her fingers.

"What the _fuck_ is your issue?" she repeats, shaking out her hand,

He grabs his nose and groans then he's on her like a cat, shoving her hard and sweeping his leg out behind her to ensure her back plants into the mat. He entwines their legs together and traps her wrists underneath a forearm while his free hand reaches up and collars her throat.

Thoirt's concern ignites their glittering bond and all the knots they've tied throughout the day undo themselves violently as Liam's bedroom door flies open and she gives full access to her tempered power to Sloane.

"You." Kavanagh barks, "You. You're so fucking incomparable to the rest of your family. Have you ever considered how unsuited you are to be a Mairi?"

He squeezes her throat hard on the sides, pressing his weight down on her, "Your brother was apparently as good as Riorson's son at wielding, riding, and fighting. Then there's you, almost at the end of your first year and barely learning to fight, only good at riding because it's part of your lineage, and can't wield because you know you're just a venin on a leash. Your mother was a rune and sword master but you couldn't even step in ger faintest shadow, you're just fucking useless. Like a supporting character."

She's manages to get a leg free and uses his bodyweight to flip them over, but Kavanagh is ready for this; grappling is his craft, not hers. He uses the created momentum to flip her again, then punches her in the face the same way she did. Her neck snaps to the left and the inertia pulls the muscles there and she yelps in pain as she turns back to look at him and the tendons strain horribly _wrong_,

"Your brother died protecting the General's daughter as he should've at the time, and you're looking for reasons to fuck primary contributor to his death?" he brings their faces so close that their lashes brush as she holds his disgusted glare, his grey eyes are dull with repulsion,

"All marked ones are traitors. None of you can be redeemed."

Thoirt's worry is muted against the bond, _"Wield, Love!"_

She screams and he wraps both his hands around her throat as she struggles beneath him, writhing as hard as she can—he's got positive control in this position. Sloane wants to laugh knowing this feeling of humility is why she sought Kavanagh out in the first place. She watched him do this in almost all of his challenges and she wonders if she looks as pathetic as the cadets who yielded to him, or worse, who died as he strangled them to death.

She frees a hand from between the two of them and slaps the mat, Kavanagh turns his head up to howl an insidious, bellowing laugh that carries as he struggles to suck in a breath afterwards. Sloane's eyes flare.

_He isn't sparring._

Her heart flutters in panic, lurching painfully as she screams for Thoirt in her mind,

_"Fight, my Love, he's coming."_ Thoirt grumbles, she hides her own panic from Sloane, who's eyes begin to fill with tears.

"Mairi, it was nice knowing you, really. You made this easy, and I look forward to being recorded as the rider who ended a family line..."

He presses his thumbs against her face, dragging the sticky blood from her nose across her lips, "And I'll make sure everyone knows you wanted to elope into oblivion with your brother's bane."

Kavanagh laughs again when she starts to tremble beneath him.

He probably thinks she's crying because she's scared. Because she trusted him. Because she couldn't get out of his hold. But he'd be _wrong_. Sloane grits her teeth and opens her mouth to scream again, but there's no noise. She feels the exhaustion settling into her muscles as he denies her oxygen, pressing down on her windpipe as she flails and trembles pointlessly against him.

_Only good at riding because it's part of your lineage..._

_Can't wield because you know you're just a venin on a leash..._

_Couldn't even step in her faintest shadow, you're just fucking useless..._

_"...your signet, Love, please. He's just there."_  Thoirt's retired her refrain and her panic consumes the rest of Sloane's viable senses as oxygen deprivation vignettes the corners of her vision. It expands like a starved fire as the fight in her shrivels up and withers away in it's wake.

She cries for her family who she'd failed, for Dain, severely misunderstood especially by her, and for Liam who would be the embodiment of disappointment if he could see her now. If she would just _wield_, she could save herself she thinks briefly; it's not a thought generated willingly, it's one brought on by fear and Thoirt's anxiety.

She could probably save herself—but for what?

And for who?

---

When she comes to Sloane is still on the mat, she registers the feeling of someone on her instantaneously. She shoves _hard,_ and when her assailant tumbles away from her, she pounces while the light pours into her eyes and her surroundings rematerialize around her.

It's not Kavanagh.

It's _Dain_.

She almost wants to laugh but she's preoccupied with determining if this was real life or the cusp of death.

"Why are you here?!" she pants, grabbing her throat when the words rip out of her and cause pain to reverberate through her body, "Kavanagh—,"

Dain holds her gaze for a moment, his eyes are wild, flickering with emotion as he runs them across her body, settling on her throat. He slams his hands into the mat and his shoulder sag as his head tumbles between his shoulders. Sloane's on high alert, and she pans over the room while Dain breathes deeply ahead of her.

Kavanagh's body lay twisted in the center of the sparring chamber with Dain's sword embedded through his torso. He'd been there so long his blood pooled beneath him in an eerily perfect circle that almost reached them about a dozen feet away,

"He can't hurt you anymore." Dain promises, head raised, "You're breathing alright?"

She nods.

"I'm so sorry I was late Mairi, I'm _so_ sorry." his voice cracks with whatever control she might've had, and the tears return, hot and heavy, "It took so long to get you breathing again..."

His voice grates unevenly and when he looks up at her his eyes are pink, and his own tears had left stained trails through the blood splattered across his face; _this_ moment right now is the most disheveled she'd ever seen him and it was for _her_.

"You were crying?"

Dain balks, before stammering harshly, "Mairi, you almost died just now—why didn't you wield?"

She reaches for Thoirt but Liam's door is shut tight,

"Mairi?" Dain's voice is impossibly gentle.

"I don't want to be here," she admits, "I don't want to be _here_."

She wasn't even sure if she wanted to be _alive_ after what had just transpired.

Dain's huge hands encompass hers and he lifts her to her feet with him, "We need to see the healers—,"

"No," she grumbles, "No, _please_."

Dain's eyes are searching her face desperately when she glances past him at Kavanagh's body.

It's been beaten thoroughly; much worse than the condition Violet's was when she was rescued from Varrish. His skin was mottled shades of black and purple and his teeth were sprinkled across the mat like a broken pearl necklace. His throat protruded on the left side awkwardly and his hands were gripping Dain's shortsword, even in his death. There was no telling what the rest of his body looked like underneath the rest of his clothing,

"Did you do that?" Sloane asked him, turning her head slowly to meet his fretting gaze,

"Yes."

"Did he hurt you?"

Dain groans, squeezing her hands in his, "No."

Her eyes swim, "Thoirt told Cath?"

"Yes," he tenses when her eyes bounce around involuntarily, "You need to lay down. I need you to see the healers, you have to I'm begging you—," he drops to his knees, rubbing his thumbs over the back of her hands,

"Please, please let them see you Mairi, your neck is black, you weren't breathing when I got here. You could have brain damage and I—,"

_Brain damage?_

Right, _if_ she was alive brain damaged wasn't a way she wanted to live.

"Okay," she leans down towards him, "Okay, take me."

Dain stands and rips his sword from Kavanagh's body, sheathing it and lifting her against his chest right after. Her stomach turned at the sight and she buried her face against his chest as he whisked her away.

She falls asleep before their arrival to the infirmary, dreaming of nothing and feeling even less.
