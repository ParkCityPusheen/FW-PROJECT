”I’ve had enough.”

Dain’s words slur together, thick with hazy unawareness, just as Sloane nudges the heavy crystal goblet he’s been drinking from to the side of his plate. The way he eats is somehow unhinged—and yet, still clean. He goes after finger foods with a fork, stabbing through as many bites as he can at once before lifting them to his mouth. His chewing is always slow, respectful, and quiet. But the pacing? He eats like someone might steal the plate away if he lingers.

He’s been drinking and eating nonstop since the meal was delivered, and she’s watched him with a quiet, curling fondness. She's happy to see him indulge with such ferocity, considering how often he’d skipped meals altogether.

Her eyes graze his profile; he’d lost a significant amount of weight; not enough to look sickly, but enough that his cheekbones were intimidating all on their own.

Still, beneath the open edge of his blouse—tugged loose when he’d stripped off his jerkin to survive the warmth of wine and company—she can see the thick rise of his pectorals, the faint shadow of muscle beneath pale fabric.

…Maybe he hadn’t lost _that_ much.

“Anymore and I’ll start regretting this evening.”

“Regretting?” Sloane repeats while pushing the goblet harder against his plate, the glass _tinks_ against the dish when he pushes back. “Gods forbid you actually enjoy yourself for once.”

Dain leans back against the throw pillows, his body tilting toward hers without quite touching, like a simple moth to flame. He drapes his arm across the back of their little conversational pit, and it settles behind her neck, warm and close.

“I just don’t want to say anything I'll regret.”

His curls tumble back in perfectly layered chaos, mussed by her fingers, and his own.

“Oh, _scandal._ A loose word from Navarre’s most polished man. Will the sun fall from the sky as well?”

“You’re insufferable.” 

Sloane sneers, leaning into his space the most she has yet. She blames the Fool’s Heat, or maybe just him, when she presses her lips to the corner of his mouth. It’s soft and teasing. His whole body goes still beneath her.

“Yet here you are, suffering.”

She slides closer, curling her knees to her chest in a show of casual defiance. His hand, still looped behind her, dips lower to cradle her shoulder. His thumb strokes the seam of her blouse—slow, absent, like he doesn’t realize he’s doing it.

“Don’t tell me you enjoy suffering.”

Dain shakes his head, “I like limits. Lines. Rules… procedures.”

“And I like breaking them. Which makes us perfect, don’t you think?”

She offers him the goblet again. It’s full of a drink she hasn’t tried yet, dark green and called *Buzzard*. He doesn’t reach for it, not at first—his hand is still tracing her bare shoulder. Then the curve of her neck. Then down, slow and idle, until his fingers ghost along the fabric draped over her spine.

“One more sip. I want to meet the man buried beneath lectures and protocols.”

“I don’t lecture,” he whines, blinking incredibly slow, obviously intoxicated.

“You just gave me a five-minute speech about *safe zones.*”

His ears redden. “Literally for your own good—”

“Or your self-preservation?”

Gianna steps out through the soft shuffle of remaining staff and patrons, her eyes locking with Sloane’s in brief acknowledgment. She reaches for the heavy cord strung beside the trellis. A hush falls around them as a curtain drops from above, silk-lined chiffon catching the light as it spills downward. The fabric flutters once, then settles, maroon and translucent, muting the world outside to a distant hum of movement and color.

Sloane’s breath stutters.

The veil of privacy transforms the pit entirely. The air feels thicker, laced with spice and intimacy. The cushions seem softer beneath her, the light warmer against her skin. For a heartbeat, it doesn’t feel like they’re in a restaurant at all. It feels like something carved out of an adult fantasy.

Dain doesn’t look away from her, not even as Gianna disappears into the background with a wink.

He watches the wonder bloom on her face, the way her shoulders drop slightly as the curtain closes out the noise and weight of the world and the musicians transition to a song with a deep, repetitive rhythm. Her fingertips trail across the embroidery on the seat beside her and her skin tickles at the reverbing bass throughout the restaurant.

When the second waitress arrives, she does so quietly, balancing a polished carafe and a single porcelain cup on a lacquered tray. She sets them down beside Dain’s plate without a word, only nodding when he meets her eye in thanks.

Coffee curls steam into the enclosed air. Its scent drifts low and rich—earthy, roasted, sweetened at the edges.

Dain reaches for the carafe slowly, still watching Sloane. His fingers brush against hers as he lifts the handle, a subtle touch, warm and steady. He pours the dark liquid into the waiting cup, then settles back into the pillows, his thigh pressed along hers, the distance between them shrinking again without effort.

“I told you,” he murmurs, voice low against the hush of the curtain. “Ambience matters.”

She regains her focus as he takes a full swallow of coffee and sets the cup down, then goes after some more of his liquor,

"I'll take another drink if you tell me about yourself." he barters, 

She rolls her eyes, finishes the rest of his drink for him, and just a moment later a full goblet appears ahead of them, set down by the hands of a waiter. His dissatisfaction shows in the way his face twists into a miserable scowl. 

“You don’t even know what I was asking about specifically.”

Sloane carefully lifts her feet and calves, sliding them up and over his thighs. She only meant to rest them there, a bit closer than before, but Dain moves before she can settle. He catches her by the hips and pulls her gently into his lap. Her back finds his chest as if it belongs there.

His hands move, and land warm and easy, masterfully making sure her skirt doesn't drag up while she slides against him. One rests low at her waist. The other slips instinctively down her bare thigh where her skirt has shifted, skin meeting skin with quiet intention. 

She forgets what she meant to say.

“I could guess,” she mutters, wondering how the manages to be so smooth when he wants to be,

“Could you?”

“My past. What my life was like before Basgiath.”

His voice comes out strained, husky. “And look at that,” he murmurs. “You’re right. I want to know more about the you no one else knows.”

“Most of who I am is who I’ve been at Basgiath, if you want me to be honest,” she admits, with her head pressed to his chest.

“But who were you before?”

She grimaces and bumps the top of her head against his chin, a gesture that would be cute if it didn’t ache.

“Not someone you would’ve been infatuated with the way you are with me now.”

“And how would you have known that?” he grunts, his hand firms gently on her thigh, thumb brushing a slow arc across her skin.

“I was only the bones of who I am now.”

Her words feel thin once spoken, worn down by the heat pressing around her. His hand moves again, casual in its pacing, and something inside her twists tighter in response. She can feel the texture of the world shift—fabric and skin and breath thickening together, as if the space between them has taken on weight.

He tilts his head. “But those bones were fleshed out to become *you*.”

She opens her mouth, but Dain speaks first.

"My dad wasn't always who he is now; I mean, granted, our relationship was never quite what a son and father relationship might look like to those who have normal ones, but it wasn't *this* either."

He hesitates, brushing his knuckles along the inside of her thigh again. The movement is slow, rhythmic, almost like he doesn’t realize he’s doing it. She feels the warmth of his hand through the fabric of her clothes, steadying her. Steadying himself.

But mostly making her ache, and wet.

She watches him contemplate between the goblet of Buzzard and coffee, but he takes neither.

“I was always kept out of the way. Definitely a second thought, maybe even a fleeting one. I got older and started training seriously with Cam, that’s when he realized goading me with familiarity worked. And I let it work. I took the bait.”

His other hand finds her hip. He rests it there and his thumb presses gently into the curve of her waist.

“I idolized him. I wanted to be like him. But I was also perfectly aware that most of him was disgusted by me.”

Dain turns his hand over again, dragging his knuckles in another pass along her thigh, lower now, pausing just above her knee. She’s been listening but the motion pulls at her attention in the quietest, most consuming way, like a nighttime undertow, dragging her to her untimely death. It’s maddening how tender he is. How natural it is for him to handle her. Sloane's body aches for something heavier, sharper, something to match the edge building under her skin.

He clears his throat, unbothered by what he’s doing to her.

“It’s strange, doing your absolute best for someone who openly despises you.”

Sloane's eyes slide shut.

She knows the feeling all too well, though not from a place of awe like Dain—for her it had been pure hatred. Unchecked and measured in wrath, and blinding in it's fury.

What got Sloane through the four years she spent separated from Liam had been *spite.*

“Thankfully I had Violet’s dad. Asher too. He coddled me, really. Mostly for Violet’s sake, but I like to think I benefitted from it.”

His chest moves beneath her cheek in a slow, quiet rhythm. She listens to the pause between each thump. Wonders how many times he’s had to swallow his own grief alone.

“In what way?” she asks softly.

He shrugs, "I was able to deviate from everything I'd been groomed to believe while existing under my father's pressure. But even then I always told myself if it were for Violet it would be an easy choice to make."

Sloane's eyes slowly raise to his, and she finds them not sparkling the way they had been, but quiet and thinking, on her with pondering depth,

“You were really in love with her?”

Dain exhales, a soft, bitter sound. “I was scared for her. And I loved her, yes. But—””

"Right. Of course you fucking were."

A moment skips over and she watches as he drifts away, eyeballing the overlapping shadows from the lanterns' iron skeletons and the pattern in the privacy curtain. His lips press together once or twice.

He leans forward slightly, the line of his chest bracing against her back in a motion so natural it doesn’t even register as intentional.

“It wasn’t like that,” he says, a little softer now. “I confused it, I think, at the time. I mistook the weight of it because of the fear. When you're constantly worried someone might die, everything blurs. It all feels sharper, more urgent. But it wasn’t romantic, not really. I just didn’t know how to separate my panic from everything else.”

Her face flushes hot, and she tries to focus on the walls of the restaurant, the soft pleats of the curtain, the shape of the light across the pillows—anything but *him*.

“And I don’t think you meant to say it like that, did you?” he murmurs, a little too pleased with himself,

“I didn’t say it like anything,” she lies, and his fingers flex slightly as if to catch the fib before it floats away.

“You *did*,” he says, quieter this time, more delighted, “and that wasn’t just jealousy. That was entirely scorned.”

Sloane doesn’t answer. She can’t, not while her face is still warm and her heart is doing something erratic and idiotic just beneath the cage of her ribs.

Dain nudges her once with his chin, low against her shoulder and she shivers when his beard prickles against the inside of her neck, “You gonna say something? Or did I ruin the moment by being honest?”

His gentle voice glides over her like a block of ice set gently to her skin, sliding without resistance, and melting on contact. The slow stroke of his fingers against her thigh becomes a second instance, steaming against her skin, impossibly light and infinitely deep, until she feels the shift in herself, the warmth blooming in answer. There’s no urgency in the way he touches her, but the ache he leaves behind is full-bodied and wet and shamefully certain between her legs.

“Can you _please_ pick a lane between lecherous retiree and hormonal schoolboy? The whiplash is ruining my drink.” she hisses, pressing her thighs together as his thumb swipes dangerously close to the hem of her panties. 

“Sure,” he coos, completely unfazed. “But I want to hear you admit it.”

“Admit *what,* Dain?”

He smiles, pleased and a little too sure of himself, like he’s won something, “That you like me enough to hate that I liked someone else.”

She groans into her palm, “You’re seriously making me play fill-in-the-blank with your ego right now?”

He pulls her back against him like she’s the reward. “I like this version of you.”

She lets her head fall back against his clavicle and soaks in the scent of him through the heady smells of food and mixed drinks,

"Sure. Petulant and loud. An emotionally unavailable man's dream."

"Honest and emotionally transparent." he tuts, "I don't deserve that."

"What would make you undeserving of *that?*"

He *kisses* just below her ear, "Of you?" he corrects,

"Of a banshee?" she bites, squirming in his lap and making him chuckle.

"What I am. And what I failed to be." he answers solemnly, drinking down the rest of the coffee, "I don't hate myself anymore, but I also don't expect good things from life or my actions. I only fight for those around me, in hopes things will be better for them in this life."

She wants to argue, to reach into that admission and peel it back until he sees what she sees—but instead, she traces around his pain, hoping to understand him instead.

He brushes her hair back gently, fingers trailing over her temple and jaw, then down her neck to her shoulder. She leans into the touch without thinking. She realizes she’s been leaning into every single one of them.

"But you offer me your love when you pursue me like this, don't you?"

Dain smiles, "Maybe I do. But I don't expect anything in return."

Sloane doesn’t answer right away. Her skin tingles everywhere he’s touched her, but there’s no pressure behind it. No asking. No claiming. Just warmth. Just him. She breathes in the feel of it, and suddenly realizes—

Dain is *always* touching her.

Light brushes of fingertips. Palms at her waist. A knuckle at her jaw, a thumb against her lip, a hand steadying her ankle, a warm palm across her thigh. She thinks back on every moment since the barracks door opened and realizes it hasn’t stopped.

Is this how he speaks when words won’t carry him?

"Can I show you? If I don't want to talk about the things that hurt me, can I show you instead?"

His body goes taut beneath hers, "How? My signet?"

She nods.

Slowly his body melts into its casual posture once more, "Sure, I'd like that."

---

So, their date ends on a good note.

Mostly.

If you overlook the fact that she had to drink herself silly just to bear the memory she peeled open for him, and how it shattered him so completely that it took the better part of thirty minutes and two entire drinks to coax him back into being the poking, unserious man he’d been earlier in the evening.

His reaction hadn’t been quiet, either—it had been radiant. Real. A heat that simmered behind his eyes, not directed at her, but _because_ of her. He’d apologized. Suggested they leave early. Sloane agreed only because they were one of the last parties remaining in the restaurant and she feared, quite sincerely, that the next table over might hear her carrying on a conversation with a man who no longer responded.

*Imagine;* somehow her foster family manages to ruin things even in their absence.

Sloane's intoxicated, though not completely void of her ability to use critical thinking, and leans on him as they walk slowly back to Riorson House under the guidance and light of a full moon.

The night air is crisp and clean and mountain breezes carry down to through the migrant village and into the streets of Aretia where it washes away the smell of spice and alcohol from their clothes.

"So..." she begins as they climb the first set of stairs of the fortress' grand staircase,

"Does this mean we get to have successful date sex now?"

Dain stumbles, which is impressive given his coordination. He recovers quickly, but his face twists toward hers in sheer disbelief, appalled and helpless.

“Successful what-now?”

“Me,” she says, pointing at herself with a slightly exaggerated gesture. “You.” She gestures toward him. And then, quite plainly:  

_“Hot sex.”_

He looks like he might have a stroke. His eyes snap to the stationed watch as they pass the second-floor landing, where two guards are very clearly pretending not to exist. A visible blush rises on one of them, the other tightens his grip on his halberd like it might help.

His eyes beam the watch, both of them, and they look away with pink dusting their faces, "Sloane watch your fucking mouth." Dain snarls, flinging the warning her way,

“We’re headed to _my_ room,” she announces, loud enough for the whole floor to catch it. “The bed is small, but it can take you.”

Dain doesn’t look at her—he looks up, as if the heavens might offer him guidance. They do not. One of the second-floor guards is already biting the inside of his cheek to keep from laughing, while the other turns very determinedly to face the opposite direction.

“And I can too, by the way,” she adds brightly. “Just need a little stretching first. You remember.”

*“Sloane,”* Dain hisses, low and strained, his jaw tightening like he might clench the words back into his throat if he could just focus hard enough.

She blinks up at him with exaggerated innocence. “What?”

“Your _mouth._”

“Yes,” she agrees, sweetly. “You can have that too.”

Dain grabs her hand as their boots click own the hallway.

“Fine. We can do it in _your_ room. Next to Bo’s, right?”

She spins around, sauntering off to the familial quarter in the opposite direction, "Sloane, no. You're drunk."

“I mean,” she continues as the scrambles to keep up, “I know we were going for the slow burn. But I'm warm and wet and *wanting*, and profoundly attracted to you. So unless wingleader copulation has a waiting period, I vote we skip the lingering and get to the part where you regret letting me take the lead.” 

"I wasn't feeling you up and even *if* you feel that way I'm not—"

"We could argue with our clothes *off*."

"Woman, it is one in the morning, please don't wake them up while we're in this hallway they're all—"

He must mean Violet and *the Sorrengail Gang.*

"Better get me in your bed or I'll drop to my knees right here and—"

He's swift when her voice climbs in volume; silencing her with his palm and swinging her ahead of his door, then unlocking it with lesser magic. Unfortunately for  him, he's not fast enough and she's not fucking done harassing him,

“Ugh,” she groans, dropping the back of her head to the door with an audible _thud_. “I cannot wait to get your cock in my mouth—”

—and it all happens faster than Dain Aetos could ever dream to be prepared for.

"Why the fuck are you back so late?"

It's unmistakably Brennan who growls at him as his door creaks open in the same moment, "Dain Aetos it's fucking two in the morning, have you lost your fucking mind?"

“So what?” Dain snaps, shouldering the door open. Sloane, still pressed against it, stumbles forward with a surprised squeak—nothing graceful about the way her legs tangle and hair fans as she careens straight into the room.

“You’re _drunk,_” Brennan spits, “and I told you—nothing heavy on your system while your symptoms are still inconsistent—_Gods,_ you’re just like Xaden, you don’t fucking _listen._ You missed your nightly checkup to run off with your damn unit and get shitfaced?”

From the floor, Sloane watches Dain move. He makes sure she doesn’t land too hard, then straightens with composure that belongs to someone raised around screaming generals. She’s still catching her breath, and he’s already about-facing like he’s running a drill.

“I’m not a fucking child,” he says flatly. “I can have a drink. _One_ missed check-up won’t kill me.”

“No,” Brennan shouts, “but the _Empyrean_ might, if you start presenting weird symptoms again. _Get your ass over here._”

Another door creaks open. Another voice—soft, unfamiliar.

“…Everything okay?”

Sloane lifts herself to standing, squinting past Dain’s shoulder, but his body fills the frame of the doorway like a wall. She can’t see who spoke.

“_Drake?!_” Brennan explodes.

“What the fuck,” Dain mutters, pivoting again. “Why are you on this floor?”

He takes a step back to investigate, promptly slamming into Sloane’s front like a warm, living battering ram. She pinwheels back into his room again, hair whipping across her mouth as she trips over her own boots for the second time.

"Why the *fuck* are you coming out of Mira's room?" Brennan snarls; his voice has raised in increments per each of his statements and now seems to peak at the sight of, allegedly, *Drake Cordella,* peaking out of his younger sister's bedroom.

Dain's weight shifts as he turns to address the flier, "Oh, is Broccoli here?"

"Dain shut the fuck up—"

"Brennan," *Ah,* Sloane covers her mouth: that's Mira, “Why are you screaming this early in the morning? Shut the _fuck_ up.*”

“Yeah, I had just brought him over,” Drake adds, calm as ever. “We can let him out if you want.”

“Mira,” Brennan’s voice spikes again, “where the _fuck_ are your _pants?_”

Sloane watches his barefeet march past Dain, her neck craning as the hallway becomes a battlefield of the half-dressed and sleep-deprived.

“On the floor,” she hears Mira reply, unbothered. “Not everyone sleeps fully clothed, you freak.”

"In the morning," Dain says to Drake,

"You and Cat hanging out tomorrow? Or you just helping in the villages again?" the flier says back,

“Will you two stop talking about the fucking cat while I’m trying to—”

Dain's arms cross and his back expands at the motion, "Catriona isn't a cat, Brennan."

"She's my cousin." Drake deadpans.

Mira scoffs, "You should go back to sleep Brennan, you're cranky."

Broccoli meows over it all—loud, offended, and perfectly timed. Sloane presses her fist to her mouth, barely managing to muffle the laughter rising in her throat like a scream.

"I agree, Brennan, you seem... *emotional.*" Dain nods.

Another door groans open.

Violet’s voice joins the fray, exasperated and half-asleep.

"Brennan can you *please* stop screaming?"

"I'm going back to sleep, Drake come get your kid and get out." Mira snaps,

"Alright. Guess I'll see you around Dain." Drake groans, "I've received my orders."'

"Think I'll go to sleep too..." Dain takes a massive backwards step into his room and Brennan nearly explodes,

"You better be up in the morning for your checkup Dain or I swear—"

Dain closes the door just barely enough for the side of his face to be seen, "Nope, I'll probably be hungover."

Dain closes the door in Brennan’s face and leans against it with the weariness of someone who’s just dodged a crossbow bolt. “Fuck,” he mutters, wiping his face with both hands. Then he slides down the wood—too fast, maybe—because his teeth grit the second his body catches the floor, a flicker of pain tightening his jaw before his knees bend and his head tilts back, like staying upright was costing him more than he let on.

“Go shower,” he commands, voice low and tattered.

“Don’t feel like it,” she hiccups. “Don’t even know where the bathing chamber is.”

“Fine. I will.”

He leans forward slowly, deliberately, the kind of motion that makes Sloane’s stomach clench. His body folds with too much caution, his breath catching as he works at his boots. He unlaces them one pull at a time, leaving them neatly by the door, but there's a tension in his shoulders that doesn't ease until he leans back again, weight off his lower spine.

“If you leave, I won’t be upset with you,” he says, eyes already dropping. “But I need to shower. I hate sleeping while feeling like this.”

She doesn’t laugh, though part of her wants to as he disappears into the attached bathing chamber at the right of a desk. 

There would be _no_ sleeping.

She nods to no one, toeing off her boots and turning to take in the room—his room.

The suite is lived-in, and it _feels_ like Dain.

Heavy furniture, revealed by dim mage light, anchors the room. Carved wood, deep green velvet, and a seating arrangement made for long evenings and quiet company. His flight jacket slouches over the desk chair, arms spilling over the sides like it gave up trying to be put away.

The desk is controlled chaos. Neat stacks of parchment and dog-eared manuals, open notes weighted with roughly cut red stones, ink pens lined precisely along the edge. The shelves behind it hold a lifetime: Navarrian texts, historical tomes, Tyrrish volumes, old first-year notebooks that haven’t been thrown out. One shelf is dedicated to Poromish culture and traditions. Another, slowly filling, to the studies and documentations about venin with spines dark and dreadful.

She catches sight of a massive cloth map pinned across the far wall, dense with clustered markers and annotations in his careful Navarrian scrawl. Its edge lifts faintly with each slow breath of the room, disturbed by a breeze that slips in unseen from somewhere past a heavy curtain.

Opposite the map wall, a full span of windows admits the night in total. Wide panes of glass stretch the room’s width, offering nothing in the way of modesty. The mountain stands just beyond, sheer and immovable, bathed in silver light. The suite is exposed to the cliffs the way Dain had exposed himself earlier: quietly, completely, and without apology.

She follows the shifting air to the wall-sized curtain near the door and pulls it aside.

A bedroom nestles behind it, warm and half-shadowed. The bed is large and clean-lined, with a terrace guarded by glass double doors just beyond. A brazier glows beside wooden chairs, the mosaic stones beneath them marked in Tyrrish greens and blacks. The firelight spills inward across the armoire and bedframe in long strokes of gold.

Dain’s world is warm. Private. Intimate without trying to be.

And suddenly, so is she.

She undresses—everything but her socks—and folds her clothes with a precision she didn’t expect from herself, slipping them into the drawer beside his. Then she pads barefoot across the office and pulls his old flight jacket from the desk chair. It’s heavier than hers, and falls well past her ass, and she zips it to the throat before sinking down into the seat like it was always meant to hold her.

The leather is worn. The cushion still shaped by his weight. The scent that rises—spice and clean wood, firs and heat—quiets the restless thing in her that hadn’t stopped pacing since dinner.

Tonight, she prays. Tonight she’d have him.

---

When the bathing chamber door opens, they lock eyes for a single second. He doesn’t speak. He just crosses the space to the enclave, clad in a large grey towel, to where his clothes are stored and reemerges with the softest-looking sleep set she’s ever seen.

"Aren't you tired?" He asks timidly, stuck where he now stands watching her at the edge of the desk and between the sofas ahead of it.

"Only a little."

It wasn't a complete lie. She was tired, but after spending the last twenty-four hours thinking about him, she's convinced herself he needs to be the one putting her to sleep.

"Congratulations on graduating." Sloane smiles up at him and his eyes glaze over, then widen into russet saucers when she rounds the desk and stands in front of him.

She bites her lip; graduation was also his and somehow the fucking universe managed to take that from him too. Graduation had been his too. Three years of war college carved into his bones; bonds forged and broken, rules memorized, excellence demanded—and for what? For someone to rip it from him and never give it back.

He gave them everything, and when it was his turn to be honored, they handed him silence.

"Thank you, Sloane."

Her name off his mouth in that husky baritone makes her weak and she commits fully to her idea through the simmering rage evoked in her heart, "I got you another gift."

He might not have had a graduation, but she could show him how he was meant to be celebrated—what it meant to be seen and chosen, not just passed over and pitied. She could give him something he definitely earned.

She eases back until the desk presses against her hips, laces her hands behind her spine, and lets her chest lift just enough to make the jacket shift. It opens a sliver, hints at skin. At _her._ The zipper is all the way up, but the implication is louder than anything she’s said tonight.

Sloane drags her eyes across his body like she’s taking inventory. His shoulders, his chest, the subtle taper of his waist, the heavy fall of his pants against his thighs. He still hasn’t moved. Still hasn’t spoken. But she watches the tension ripple through him, slow and helpless.

His eyes flicker to the patch stitched along the shoulder of his jacket, the wingleader insignia bold against borrowed leather.

“What is it?” he asks.

She doesn’t answer. Just lifts one hand and runs her fingers slowly across the stitched emblem, and watches as the realization spreads through him—

Dain opens his mouth once.

Twice.

And the only thing she can think is: _finally._

Then he crosses the space between them slowly, deliberately, and lifts the edge of the metal zipper. Sloane watches every vein that rises along the back of his hand and tracks them up his wrist to where they vanish beneath the black sleeve of his blouse.

"Wingleader, huh?" he murmurs,

She squeezes her thighs together before answering. They’ve never stood this close—not with this much tension. His hair is still damp and curling against his forehead, the freshly washed scent of him is insanely intoxicating and it makes her giddy. She splays her hands against the top of the desk and leans back, then lifts her chin up to look up at him,

"Today's technically your last day as one, so..." she whispers, watching as something unfurls in the earthy depths of his irises.

His breathing is forced and deep, and he rubs the zipper pull one last time then drops his hand to his side,

"So, what?" his head dips down to angle over hers, and their lips barely brush—almost touch. The minty gust of his breath feels like an icy chill across her flushed face and her eyelids flutter.

Sloane can feel the beating of her heart between her legs.

Should she have showered too?

“So... it’s your last chance to break one of your rules, wingleader.” she tells him,

She chokes down her last breath and leans back farther onto the desk before taking his hand and placing it back on the zipper, once he grabs it she pulls his wrist down. 

They both watch as the jacket peels open and Sloane bears herself to him.

She analyzes every reaction.

The way he lets the zipper go gently once the jacket is fully open and moves back to fill his vision with the sight of her. She sees the goosebumps peppering his skin, his heart beating in that dip between his clavicle at the bottom of his throat.

He eases the jacket down her shoulders as she slides onto the desk. His hands are always so calloused and she loves that, she loves feeling his skin prickle over hers and when she leans into his touch, rubbing her cheek against his hand, he trembles at the sight and shifts his weight.

His throat bobs as his hands trace slowly over the front of her body, whispering down her sternum, across her belly button and then he uses both hands to spread her thighs open.

Dain leans over her against the desk, placing his palms against the wood and shoving his face into the juncture of her shoulder and neck. He bites her, hard, then licks over the skin and pulls her hair out of the jacket with one hand. He runs his fingers through it at the base of her head.

Thank Zihnal that she brushed it out because his long digits slide through them like silk and he groans.

"For me?" is all he mutters as he pulls back to kiss along her jaw,

"For you." she answers softly,

He steps back, runs his fingers across the bottom of one of her breasts where Thoirt's wing stretches beneath it.

"Are you sure you—"

*"Dain Aetos."* she bites, narrowing her eyes at him.

"Show me."

Sloane gives him a look; under the mage lights, she’s certain her whole body must be glowing a peachy pink.

Dain licks his lips, then taps her thigh gently and expectant. “Show me what you like.”

"Oh," she shudders, *"oh."*

No one had ever asked her that before. Not like this. Not with patience. Not with this wonder.

"Can that be part of my gift?"

She doesn't answer right away, she let's that irresistible smoke behind the clean cut syllables of his escaping Navarrian accent billow over her skin.

She can sense it, his unraveling, quiet but total. The heat in his gaze is more than want; he's committing himself to her in a kind of aching devotion that scorches through the air between them.  His eyes roam over her like she’s something sacred and impossible—like touching her will break whatever spell he’s sure he’s under. It’s not just disbelief; it’s awe. Raw and consuming. And it drags a shiver down her spine.

She can feel his hands, not even on her yet. She’s wet, aching, delirious, watching this man disestablish his entire character facade—because of her.

"Is that what you want?" she finally asks, softly, though she already knows he does. He’s wearing it like a second skin.

He licks his lips again, "Yes."

Sloane breathes in slow and deep.

She takes his left hand and presses it on her breast, "We were training once, when I was in my sleep wear," her voice hitches, "and my nipples kept rubbing against the edge of the table while you were talking..."

She glances up at him, and watches his shoulders dip, his head tilts back like her words knock the air out of him.

"I like the way you grab me in my sleep." she takes his right hand and shoves it against her hip, "After the time you saved me, you grabbed me just like this."

He pinches her waist, thumb pressing into that soft dip to her pelvis and she gasps. It tickles, just enough to make her twist against the desk with a breathless laugh. Dain rolls her nipple between his fingers and pulls. Heat bleeds through her veins and into her skin. Sloane bucks against the desk, thighs clenching; she can’t help the moan that tears out of her and fills the room.

I…” she gasps. “You—when you kissed me in the archives... I wanted you to touch me anywhere but you only kissed me, and then you just—," her laughter is a feigned breath, "you just walked away and left me like that."

"I touched myself that night." he admits roughly,

"Show me." she hisses, grabbing at his pants,

He looks at her like she just gave him the sun.

And then he obeys.

Dain pulls desperately at the tie of his pants, then reaches into them, unfurling his heavy cock. He's fawn there, smoother than where he is everywhere else—apricot across his shaft with bulging green veins, dark and peachy at his crown. He fidgets as her eyes rake over his length; it's long, and it's thick. She'd braved length before, but this girth and curve?

Never.

She grabs his shaft, sits up straighter on the desk, and drags him between her spread legs. He watches her hand on him like he’s dreaming it. Like he doesn't know if he'll survive the feel of her. He groans again when she rubs her thumb and index finger over his leaking slit.

His face ignites in flame when she brings the hand she fondled him with to her face, pinching her fingers and pulling them apart so they can both watch the sticky web of precum fall from between them.

"Fuck—Sloane." he rasps, running a hand through his hair and placing the other over her own.

She removes hers and places them behind her, leaning back on her arms on top of the desk while he strokes himself. They're slow, twisted tugs that pull the skin taught against him, he watches her for the first few strokes, then throws his head back while he plays with his tip; thrusting it through his fist a few times before snapping his face down again. He collapses over her, pressing his face back into her neck and panting.

"Keep going," she purrs into his ear, biting his lobe and letting her hands wander.

She touches him gently, cautiously as she can; avoiding his sutures as she butterflies her fingertips up the furry trail of hair to his naval. The teenager in her squeals and nearly screams as her fingers are guided by the sharp indentations of his abs to his thick pecs. She mimics his touch from earlier—twisting and pulling his nipples,

"Sloane," he begs, bucking roughly, "again, please."

Her eyes just about roll into her fucking head. 

"This?" she asks, assaulting his neck while rubbing her thumb across his nipple and twisting with the side of her index finger, then pulling hard,

"Yes."

She does. She fondles his other nipple and starts touching herself too. Dain leans almost entirely against her and Sloane's vision is eclipsed by the broad expanse of his chest and shoulders. She's fucking high on the thrill of him, and as much as she is turned on, seeing this desperate side of him makes her feel so powerful she was practically overdosing.

He had always looked so composed.

But here—above her—he’s unraveling, every carefully held part of him coming loose. She becomes frustrated when she can't see him stroke himself and lays flat against the desk, watching as he holds himself up with one arm braced against it, thrusting into his hand.

His pace of choice is slow, but thorough; he doesn't pull away until the base of his pelvis presses against his hand and when it does he pulls all the way out, and over, and over, and over. 

"You like to watch?" Dain mutters, "You wanted to watch me, Sloane?"

He taunts her with his face burnt by his own blush, his eyes lost on everything except her. She runs her fingers through the wet skin between her legs, shivering when he stops his own movements at the sounds of her neglected lust beneath him.

She lets him enjoy the sight of herself for a few moments before squirming,

"Touch me," she commands,

Sloane was thinking he'd mock her movements too but instead he grabs her thighs and pulls her ass over the edge of the desk, drops to his knees, and settles his tongue on her pussy like he's fucking starved. He gets his tongue flat, first, and licks her from entrance to clit, lets her rub herself against it, watching while her fingers pull at his scalp.

She's swearing his name as he sucks her clit into his mouth, he rolls it between his tongue and teeth gently as the sensations pillow inside of her, building pressure beneath her stomach,

"You're fucking soaked Sloane," he mutters against the inside of her thigh, "Were you this wet when you took off your clothes and put on my flight jacket?"

"Since my shower," she admits,

He groans at that—low, wrecked—and presses his face back into her, like he wants to live there. 

He nips the inside of her thigh and sighs, “I’m going to die.”

"Not yet," Sloane hisses, "Fuck me first,"

"Can I?" he asks, eyes fogged, voice heavy,

"If you don't I'll report you to leadership." she snaps,

His laugh makes her spasm against the desk.

Its always so fucking rich and deep and gentle and it undoes her nervous system like drugs whenever she hears it.

Dain sinks a finger into her, "I guess I have to," she clenches around his finger and moans, "But I need to stretch you first."

"No..."

*Gods*—she's not sure when the room started spinning but it hasn't stopped.

"Just give it to me," she grabs his face with her hands, "give it to me now."

He blinks, looks like he wants to say something, but he obliges her in the end.

Dain grabs himself at the base and rubs his head against her pussy, coating himself in her arousal before pressing his tip at her entrance, he pokes, and prods, and teases until she's holding the edge of the desk with her knees bent and spread wide trying to impale herself on him,

“Slow,” he croaks—his voice breaking deeper, cavernous, shaking through the room like thunder.

Dain grabs her just above her hips and his huge hands engulf her whole fucking waist. They wrap around her like a corset; squeezing her in at the core, applying a dangerous, addictive pressure. He rolls his hips, head falling between his shoulders as he feels her out—pulling back, then sinking in again, slow and deliberate.

He wets himself again with her arousal as he digs deeper, teasing every inch. Their breathing synchronizes when he's finally planted himself as far as he can go—he looks down at Sloane, but she's not there. She's mewling, scratching at his forearms,

"You're deep," she gasps, "you're deep."

Dain strokes her hip bones with his thumbs, "Mhmm..." he chuckles, "you want it?"

"Yes," Sloane breathes, turning her chin down to see where they've been connected.

"Can you take it?" he asks gently as he starts pulling out, "Tell me if its too much,"

Sloane focuses only on the feeling—how he grazes against the softest parts of her, how even half-withdrawn she already aches to have him again. He moans as he pushes back inside of her, slowly, scraping, stretching.

"I can't believe I'm inside of you," he sighs, fully seated once again. He straightens his upper body and leans over her to kiss her.

He moves like he’s etching her into memory. Every inch he takes feels like a vow—one he doesn’t speak aloud, but makes with his whole body. He kisses her like it'll be their last every time their lips meet. He sucks on her tongue. Leisurely explores hers mouth with his.  

Dain is in no fucking rush to enjoy her—and she’s not used to this.

"Dain, fuck me," she pants into his mouth.

Sex was dirty and fast and an afterthought the next day, but with Dain it felt more personal, intimate, a ritual—she feels exposed and explored.

"I am, Sloane."  he whines,

He stands up and finally pulls out—then sinks back in, still slow and controlled, "You feel divine."

"Then fuck me *harder*," she demands, shaking her hips beneath him.

"No," he bites gently at her jaw, voice low. "Not yet. I want it like this."

He kisses her again and she spirals into oblivion.

She’s a tangled mess of unraveling knots as he thrusts into her, overwhelming her with the sheer weight of him. His moans echo in her skull, vibrate down her spine. There’s a dull pain deep inside her, but she welcomes it. Let's it kindle into a devastating blaze, let's it burn her to ashes in its wake.

He’s pressing into where she fucking ends.

"Sloane," he breathes reverently, craving while pressing her legs together and draping them across his body, *"Sloane."*

"Dain, your stitches—,"

She realizes he's picking up his pace and stops talking as he leans back for leverage. Sloane watches the ripple of his abs, the dip of them down to his pelvis. He bites at her socks, rips them away with his teeth, presses his face into the soles of her feet as he drives into her relentlessly. He eyes her tits while they bounce to each of his thrusts. She's consumed by the sight of him, the feeling of him dominating her senses entirely, finally.

He rubs his bearded cheek against her ankles as her name spills past his lips in a desperate cadence, her lower abdomen tightens with each stroke; he's penetrating against her where no one had before, consistently and efficiently. She lets herself ogle his biceps, forearms, his veined hands crossed at the chest to hold her legs against him. She touches herself through the gap at the apex of her thighs, because she has to—because everything he’s doing to her is too much, and still somehow not enough.

"Sloane," he trembles, "Can I come in you, please?"

"Yes *please*," she mewls, "I'm on—we can—,"

He folds her legs against her, slides his hands to her calves and presses her ankles down by her head. "You can take it, okay? Be good."

She’s pinned—folded in half like the books next to them, breath catching high in her chest, every inch of her open to him.

Something in her gut flips, she glances at her feet just past her head and back at him, "Take what?"

Dain lifts himself onto his toes, angling himself to penetrate straight on, pinning her legs flat against the desk at her calves as he plunges into her the deepest, roughest, the wildest he has yet, and she claws at his forearms.

"I—*Dain!*"

She screams his name as he drives into her, hard enough to scatter papers and thick tomes from the desk with a thunderous crash. The desk itself howls in disbelief, creaking and bending beneath them. He glances at the mess, then back at her, unrelenting.

Each stroke lands with obscene precision, every connection louder than her breathless cries. The obscene, wet sound of him inside of her floods her ears, flushes her skin with hot, shivering shame. It's the combination of letting herself want him, lusting after him, and now finally having him that drags her to her orgasm. The sight of him all over her and it not being enough for him, her name past his teeth and off his full lips—the way he closed his eyes after burning a glare through the ceiling of his suite like he had a bone to pick with each God.

His kept curls rubbing against her clit while he fucks her for all she's worth.

Sloane can barely breathe—still she takes him, stretching around him, opening wider with every stroke. Her moans turn to pleading cries as his heavy sack slaps against the curve of her ass.

Her orgasm crashes into her so hard she doesn’t ride it—she’s ridden by it, dragged through it, helpless to anything but the stretch of him inside her and the weight of his body above hers. She twitches uncontrollably, legs trembling underneath him—and still, he doesn’t stop. Doesn’t even hesitate. Letting go isn’t an option. He wants her like this—and he’s going to take it.

There’s no reprieve. Not from his stretch, from his pressure, from the breathless praise he presses into her throat between strokes. She’s overstimulated to the point of tears, and all he does is kiss her and whisper, “You can take it—you asked for this.”

Her head thuds softly against the wood; this can't be her wingleader.

Codex-kisser Dain who had never shown anything outside of manicured readiness and perfectly followed guidelines. If Sloane had known he was going to fuck her into his desk with the strength of some unnamed warlord she would've written a will and taken more leave days to recuperate.

Maybe pushing for more was a mistake.

What had she worried about his health for?

Her mouth falls open stupidly—was walking an option after this??

“I can feel you... fluttering on my cock, Sloane,” Dain grates, voice broken, panting, sweating.

He was floating somewhere behind his eyes, drunk on sensation and barely tethered to the moment.

Sloane watches as he undoes himself; his long eyelashes beating open and closed in rapid repetitions, his thighs spasming against her ass and the muscles of his abdomen rippling underneath his skin. His neck snaps backwards and he pants as he pumps into her. Sloane fixates on the feelings of him engorged and filling her, his cock twitching violently inside her, thick and impossibly tight in the space she’s somehow still making for him.

"Sloane?"

Dain unfolds her and drops her legs off the edge of the desk.

"...Sloane?"

He’s hovering—wide-eyed, sweat-glossed, he seems unsure if he’s broken her while wrangling his own breathing.

She’s splayed across his workspace, utterly wrecked, breath shallow and uneven, eyes barely slivered open.

“Sloane,” Dain whispers, brushing sweat-slick hair from her forehead. “You with me?”

She blinks once, slow. Her lips part, but nothing comes out.

Dain exhales shakily, leans down, and presses a kiss to her shoulder—soft, almost penitent. When he pulls away, there’s still space left behind; her body doesn’t register the absence. Every part of Sloane still answers to him, slow to reshape to itself.

He returns with a shallow basin from his bathing chamber, fills it with steaming water, and wrings a cloth out until it drips slow and clean. He starts with her neck. Then her chest. Her thighs. Every swipe of the cloth is deliberate, tender—slow enough that she could stop him if she wanted to. Sloane doesn’t. Her breath just goes softer, longer.

He washes her one careful section at a time. Between her legs, Dain moves gently, timidly, like an apology especially when she trembles as the cloth grazes her overstimulated core.  He lifts her and she falls against him, allowing him access to her soaked back.

Once Dain's satisfied she’s warm, clean, and not leaking sweat into the desk grain, he presses another kiss to her knee and gathers her into his arms. She’s pliant, weighted and barely conscious, her lashes stutter against his collarbone.

He carries her to the bed, lays her down like it's routine for him.

She's covered first with the soft flat sheet, then the feather stuffed duvet, and Dain burrows in beside her—after stepping away to shower himself, clothed only in a new set of sleeping pants. 

He takes one of her hands as sleep truly overtakes her—faintly trembling still—and starts rubbing slow, lazy circles into her palm with the pads of his fingers. Then each knuckle. Then her wrist. He rubs them all methodically as she drifts away.

He watches her eyes close, shifts closer and rests against the crown of her head.

"When you wake up, I’ll be here,” he murmurs, planting a long, soft kiss against her forehead, “Sleep.”

And she does.

He stands up and finally pulls out—then sinks back in, still slow and controlled, "You feel divine."

"Then fuck me harder," she demands, shaking her hips beneath him.

"No," he bites gently at her jaw, voice low. "Not yet. I want it like this."

He kisses her again and she spirals into oblivion.

She’s a tangled mess of unraveling knots as he thrusts into her mouth and her cunt—overwhelming her with the sheer weight of him. His moans echo in her skull, vibrate down her spine. There’s a dull pain deep inside her, but she welcomes it. Let's it kindle into a devastating blaze, let's it burn her to ashes in its wake.

He’s pressing into where she fucking ends.

"Sloane," he breathes—reverent, craving—pressing her legs together and draping them across his body, "Sloane."

"Dain, your stitches—,"

She realizes he's picking up his pace and stops talking as he leans back for leverage. Sloane watches the ripple of his abs, the dip of them down to his pelvis.

"I—Dain!"

She screams his name as he drives into her, hard enough to scatter papers and thick tomes from the desk with a thunderous crash. The desk itself howls in disbelief, creaking and bending beneath them. He glances at the mess, then back at her, unrelenting.

Each stroke lands with obscene precision, every connection louder than her breathless cries. The insidious, wet sound of him inside of her floods her ears, flushes her skin with hot, shivering shame.

She twitches uncontrollably, legs trembling underneath him—and still, he doesn’t stop. Doesn’t even hesitate. Letting go isn’t an option. He wants her like this—and he’s going to take it.

There’s no reprieve. Not from his stretch, from his pressure, from the breathless praise he presses into her throat between strokes. She’s overstimulated to the point of tears, and all he does is kiss her and whisper sweet nothings,

“You can take it—you asked for this.”

"You said you wanted me, you have to take all of me Sloane."

"I'll "

Her head thuds softly against the wood; this can't be her wingleader.
