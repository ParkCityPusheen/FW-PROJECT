It's early.

Just before the sun glints through the terrace windows, Dain stirs to life, stretching his arms and legs downwards in that cat-like way that he does. He licks around the inside of his mouth and works at his throat, grunting while his eye flutter open and settle at Sloane's hip. They hood immediately, narrowing into affectionate, caramelized pools of brown sugar as they inch across her body.

He releases a heavy sigh as he roves over the sight of her scribbling away at her assignment workbook for geography and navigation, preparation for RSC, using her physics textbook as a makeshift surface for leverage. She'd been awake for an hour or two at this point, gotten up to brush her teeth and hair and settled into his desk as she completed her monthly assessment of Thoirt when she caught his groan and the tell-tale shuffling he did whenever he searched for her warmth in the bed. She had retreated back to the mattress with the rest of her schoolwork so he could settle subconsciously,

"Navigation..." he grumbled, stretching again with his eyes stuck on her face now,

She nodded, nibbling at the tip of her ink pen, "We got an impromptu lesson from Aaric yesterday during lunch; I'm so glad I actually paid attention."

"Me too," her lover snorts.

*"Me too."* Thoirt mimics—Sloane adopts a soft smile before biting into her lower lip, sparing Dain an affectionate once-over before refocusing; there's only a bit left, and she wants it done before he falls into his routine and denies her his girthy length.

She's stuck on a think-piece about utilizing topology from thousands of meters above infantry units, she's meant to overcome an enemy who has the upper hand of her skyward unit and infiltrate with the soldiers with their dragons as a distraction.

“You’re strategizing already?” he mumbles, voice rough.

She hums. “Trying. Enemy’s grounded but fortified. And they know we're closing in from above.”

He reaches over, fingers trailing her wrist before tugging some of her hair between his fingers,

“You’re thinking like a hawk. Be the fox you are instead instead.”

She arches a brow and Dain closes his eyes again, but keeps talking.

“Send the dragons high—loud, fire, distraction. But you move with the terrain. Use forests and rivers like veins. Slip through them. Let the land fold you onto them.”

“Surprise them by closing the perimeter where I can.”

He levies a satisfied hum of his own that sows into her chest and between her thighs, "Make it feel like the land itself turned on them while they focus on what little advantage they *think* they have from above."

She looks at him, just a foot away from her.

"Don't plan to outmaneuver them." she builds, "*Swallow* them."

Dain blinks away his ashen-brown hair, and the sun catches against the glinting blonde highlights that run through his sleep-tousled curls; he smiles sickeningly sweet, ravaging her soul with an insatiable sensation of longing that she couldn't possibly quench.

Gods, he's *right there* but it isn't enough.

She feels like she needs to be inside his skin.

"Are you shaking?" she muses as she observes him, focusing on his hand folded against the mattress underneath his pillow, "Why are you shaking?"

He groans, and rolls onto his back, running his palms along the side of his face,

"Any morning I wake up and you're right here. Next to me—*tangible,*" his eyes are burning a hole through the ceiling, "The feeling of finally being someone's..."

He turns his head onto his cheek to look at her, to suck in the sight of her through the molasses peaks and honeyed trails of his chocolate eyes, "I experience it all over again for the first time every time I open my eyes and see you next to me,"

He starts *trembling.*

She can't find the words, but it isn't unlike him at all to leave her speechless, to show her that she'd never find a love like this with anyone else. Sloane let's his feelings settle into her skin and drops her ink pen to lean into him, capturing his lips in a deep kiss over her assignments.

Dain runs a hand along the side of her face, caressing her jaw when she pulls away,

"I want you forever, Sloane. In every parallel thread we exist in. I want you slow, I want you painful—carved into my skin if that’s what it takes to feel every bit of what you've given. As long as it’s *you.*"

"Only you." she whispers to him; her face has heated to a blotched watercolor painting, overlapping in pinks and reds.

This time he kisses her.

He coaxes her away from her navigation assignment—not that it's difficult when he stands up and stretches, stretching his tan skin across his thick muscles, reaching each of his arms behind him and lowering himself to touch his toes,

"Come shower with me." He said, holding out his hand to her.

Of course it's never just a shower, not with Dain.

He practically waterboards himself while taking her with his mouth, stroking himself eagerly underneath her as he laved at her, chanting her name like prayers the way he always did. Sloane finds purchase at his scalp, pulling roughly as he brings her to her first orgasm with her leg thrown over his shoulder and her toes spread wide.

She implodes in on herself and the world spins white as she slides down the tiled wall of his shower; he guides her down to him and takes her against the mosaiced floor tiles. He leans back on his knees to maneuver her—slides her into his lap and spreads her *wide,* propping his head into the crook of her shoulder and neck, lifting her with his hands behind her knees effortlessly and lancing her with his thick cock until his body spasms and he sluggishly drops and collapses over her. She's squashed between the expanse of his trained body and the warmed wall of the shower, hyper-focused on the feeling of him emptying himself inside of her, panting her name unabashedly while his erection pulses inside of her.

"I want you," he gasps, "I *need* you."

He begs *so* good for her, she thinks reverently: he *belongs* to her.

She means to say something back, but he takes her with his hands and it's just a twist and a stroke of his fingers before she's milking the last of his climax with the beginning of her second.

It's an administrative day for Dain, so he leaves the door to his suite ajar when they leave to get breakfast. It's only about nine but he's had business and duty come knocking far earlier. Door ajar meant absent and his wards kept people out, closed meant occupied, and cracked meant available. Often times the floor aide or watch would divulge his absence to those seeking him to keep the floor from swarming.

They dress at a leisurely pace, watching fattened snowflakes fall against the window, and Sloane wears her winter flight leathers and jacket.

Dain though?

Civilians—it's a feast for her eyes and *every* female that passes by.

His blouse is crisp, cream in color, and made of a lush, heavy fabric that only Sloane is privy to see while they dress. Over it he wears an even thicker gambeson that nearly reaches his knees, a sequence of buckles climb up the far left breast of it just before the high collar. It's pitch black in color like the thick trousers he wears tucked into a pair of coffee-bean colored boots that he's polished to a muted shine. A forest green cloak hangs over his shoulders and clavicle, billowing at his sides as they stride through the Grand Hall to the dining mess, when they sit to eat the thick, tawny-furred hood crowds at his shoulders and makes him look warm and *fuzzy.*

He drinks his first cup of coffee with his eyes plastered to hers and an arched brow.

"You look *good.*" She purrs, pointing her fork at him, "If only you noticed the eyes you captured."

He snorts, "I don't know about looking nice, but this feels so much better than leathers."

"I wouldn't know," Sloane frowns, "but when I graduate I might."

"You will." A greedy smirk transcends his face, "I've pictured it a few times."

"Oh, have you?"

A blush feathers the top of his cheeks and ears and he rolls his eyes before plopping a boiled egg into his mouth.
