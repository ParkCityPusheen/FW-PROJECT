### [Chapter 7](https://archiveofourown.org/works/63478354/chapters/164763514): Dain | Red Remembrance

Sloane's been... evolving.

He notices it during weapons training; she's absolutely drenched and biting the inside of her cheek the whole match. Impressively, she also doesn't draw a single dagger; she only grapples. Dain watches with his mouth wide open, eyes stretched in disbelief, when she squares up with a male an inch or two taller and bulkier than herself. He's sinewy and lean, yet their physiques parallel each other and while she typically struggles a great deal to win her match ups. Today, she's focused. He can feel the assuredness emanating around her like sunlight, the atmosphere on the mat is intense and Sloane's demeanor is.

She waits for him to lunge first, circling each other to see who has the edge, and sidesteps the motion on purpose to let him grab her, then she twists downwards to swing a leg out effectively sweeping him to the floor. Her hair's braided in twin plaits down her crown like usual, but pinned into a neat, voluminous bun that becomes unraveled as she coils her body around his on the mat. Everything is calculated on her part, and Dain is enraptured her emotionless face while she dances around his unsuspecting figure like a fucking wildcat. She entwines herself around his leg, effortlessly bending at her knees over the sideways length of his body, capturing, and contorting it at a lethal angle,

_"Yield,"_ she breathes, voice even, chest heaving, "Or I'll fucking break it."

Dain's sure his mouth couldn't possibly fall any wider, but when the male taunts her with a laugh while grabbing her ass as it lays against his ribs, it just about dislocates as Sloane's body shifts lethally, popping the limb right out of its fucking socket with a dense _thwock._ His body, and her unraveled braids, follows her own body as she alters their positions, flipping him into the mat face first, where his nose breaks. She dislodges herself from him completely out of breath and her hunched, wheezing stance is the only mildly unplanned transaction she's completed the entire match.

He's screaming beneath her when they make eye contact, and she stands up a bit straighter.

"Incredible," Dain mutters impulsively, her piecing stare makes goosebumps erupt across his neck and forearms, "You're incredible."

"Of course I am." She sneers, "I'm the _last_ Mairi."

She stalks off to Matthias and Imogen, who are very clearly as shocked as he is.

In battle brief he can tell she bides her time shuffling through the bodies of iron squad, making sure she's behind Dain so she can get the next seat to his before Cat.

_"Maybe your favored favors you,"_ Cath suggests curiously,

His favored. He doesn't fight it anymore, not that Cath gives a shit.

_"I will never again assume feelings are mutual."_

Cath pauses, then chuckles, _"Ah. Yes, the sibling."_ They both mean Violet, and Dain jabs his swordtail with disapproving breezes across the wasteland.

When they're seated she opens her notebook and raises her head to his, the movement is so obvious he looks down at her,

"It might be later for us tonight; I'm getting grappling lessons again."

Dain drops his head, replying in a low tone, "Imogen?"

"Kavanagh." She answers, "The other Wing."

His head jerks back a bit, "When did this happen?" He questions her knowing she might not answer, but hopes.

"He said I need to develop my own tactics. Grappling because I'm a siphon; if I can lock them down I can take... everything that they have in actual combat."

"Well he's right, pretty ingenious." Dain praises their efforts,

She hadn't had a style to fall into when approaching opponents, and it was clear the adaptation of one was what she needed to give her the leverage she needed in hand-to-hand combat. Something in his mouth tastes sour, and the oily awareness that it wasn't himself who got her these results makes him lick his lips. Shitty wingleader he was.

"I'm going to stop running from it." Sloane whispers to him, her respite evident, "The same way Violet did."

He's a bit thrown at her sudden resolve but no other scenario could be better than this one, and although that means she'll be more willing to throw herself into danger that makes him want to suggest another way, he doesn't. He remembers the growing loathing in Violet's facial expressions that he never let himself see when trying to dissuade her. What Sloane needed was encouragement. A grin breaks across his face, and by force of un-fucking-fortunate habit, he ghosts a hand against her cheek turning her face up to his, "You'll be amazing, I have no doubt."

She blinks at him, and before either of them can react, he drops his hand and dismisses himself from the class.

Fuck.

"Aetos? Ridoc?"

Both men look up from the entryway, just before the posted watch. Matthias and Sloane are standing down the hall coming from the direction of the sparring gyms.

Ridoc had followed him out of Battle Brief.

"Where'd you guys go—Aetos are you wearing civs?" Matthias guffaws, her braided hair is pulled up into tight ponytail... as is Sloane's.

He doesn't answer, just watches Sloane the same way she watches him. Her sparring uniform hugs her as if it were fitted right there on her body; like some seamstress cut the fabric, pinned it, and had it sown expertly against the curve of her hip, the rounding of her breasts, and the shelf of her ass. He tilts his head to see her high, secured ponytail, pulled tight at the edge of her head; her hair is a thick waterfall of golden silks behind her, waving in the night from the gusts escaping into Riorson House. Dain relishes on the memories of her cool tresses sliding across his arm, the smell of them under his nose as she slept. In the lighting provided by mage lights above he can see the svelte, taught lines of her abs under her black shirt, and the light bulge in her quadriceps as she reacclimates her weight across her hips. He stands up straighter when her shirt rolls against her midsection at the repositioning, revealing a sliver of skin and that rigid purchase of bone that disappears beneath her waistband. He'd go back a year in training just to fit his fingers around them. To use them to pull her against him like pommels.

"Poromish civs." Ridoc exclaims, tugging at the seam work across the bottom of Dain's tunic and effectively breaking him out of his trance,

"It's Troy's." Dain comments defensively, not that there's anything wrong with his roommate, or Poromish anything, "I didn't really pack anything the day we left, and all my uniforms are dirty."

Ridoc points at the expertly crafted rucksack, "We went into town to pick up the clothes he ordered."

They had. Ridoc caught him leaving the service facilities floors to get his uniforms washed, followed him to the stables from the fortress where he borrowed Brennan's mount, and then to Aretia to pick up the clothing and back. Dain hadn't planned on returning to Navarre after graduation so it made sense to start purchasing the necessities while here.

Dain holds up the rucksack holding the new clothing, "Training?" He asks Sloane as they get closer,

"Death by Imogen and squad leader." She nods, "Are _we_ still training?"

"Do you want to?" He gives her the option, no need to wear her out if she doesn't want to now that they have a legitimate programming,

"If we just do the remedial stuff again," She rubs her arm, "I've been sparing for hours now."

"And you will be every night until you move less like an aristocrat and more like a weapon." Imogen threatens, she walks past all of them, "Good night fourth wing."

"Every night, huh?" Dain muses,

"She's getting the the hang of it, though." Matthias chuckles, she waves goodbye to Imogen and turns back to them.

"Certainly is." Dain chuckles and gives her a reassuring glance, "Second year will be a breeze for you if you keep this up. You're excelling, and much faster than you think."

He thinks about her body entwining that bastard's who grabbed her ass, and wonders how warm it was between her legs when she set herself atop of him. His hands twitch.

Matthias pats Sloane on the head, "Remember, pick a weapon and stick to it." She turns to Dain, "_Actually_, since she's about to be with you anyway, maybe figure that out?"

"Weapons?" He hums,

"Mhmm," Matthias pauses for a moment, "I think daggers are her strong suit."

Dain gives his section leader an incredulous stare, "It doesn't matter; she needs to be able to defend herself in the Quadrant. She's a marked one, and I don't want us leaving her less prepared because of her _preferences_. Daggers have to happen."

"I'm aware Aetos. I just think dagger's aren't her _calling_—maybe something that'll let her be far enough back to make assessments as she goes for when she picks her fights. She can adapt quickly when things aren't busy around her."

"Bowstaff? A glaive?" He brainstorms, thinking hard for her. Polearms could be dangerous enough with consistent training like any other weapon. They provided reach, fatality and demanded grace and dexterity.

"Or even a spetum." Matthias adds.

"I've seen a folding spetum; amazing conceptually if you think about the multiplicity in reach that would give a person." He blabbers, Matthias's eyes twinkle and feels the uncanny sensation of belonging for a sliver of a moment before tucking it away.

Ridoc's and Sloane's eyes bounce between the two of them, "Wow, this is literally so neat and corny at the time." he grunts.

"She'd be the first person in the Quadrant to wield that. I can't begin to imagine what it's sparring sequence would look like." Matthias beams, ignoring Ridoc.

Sexy as fuck, Dain ponders as he imagines her spinning it around her body.

Matthias prattles even faster, "And considering what I heard about the control dagger today, what about a crossbolt? We have tons of fliers that can get her up to speed, and she'd feel less like her dragon is doing all the work during flight formations. She could weaponize different types of arrowheads."

_And_ it would keep her at distance enough to recognize when the risk is too much, allowing her to fallback when needed even if she was at the front lines. Yes, he thinks, crossbolts.

"You can't fire crossbolts accurately off the back of a dragon." Sloane hisses stubbornly, "That would take forever to master while moving."

"False." Dain snips, "Safer, and _more_ dangerous. And the fliers are here now, they're more adept at it than we have ever been. Remember, one of our professors was almost slain by a flier's arrow."

"Advocating for Poromish war tactics in your Poromish attire wingleader Aetos? I like it." Matthias pushes him gently and saunters off after saying goodnight to them alongside Ridoc who follows her, "That takes care of that, Sloane!"

"Shall we?" Dain motions, walking away before Sloane can disagree.

She follows him to the terrace and he sets the bag down on the iron table. She peaks at it, then opens it after he says nothing as she reaches for it.

"This is Tyrrish tailoring." She accuses him after unfolding one of the shirts, her voice slides against him like cold silk and he almost shivers,

"I got fitted in Tyrrendor, of course they are."

She turns to him, face flushed and her ponytail lagging behind her, "I was thinking this was a bag of Poromish clothes."

"Went today to pick them up and last week for the order, in Aretia." He says plainly,

He walks over and sits on the stone bench, looking for Cath's shape before the mountains.

"Can you pull this off?" Sloane pipes up brightly, unfurling a black leather vest and its companioned blouse,

"I just let the staff pick out whatever for me, and some things off of mannequins." Dain admits, his mood levels at the sight of her smile and he hopes they can maintain hers.

"Try it on," she tells him, thrusting the pair towards him, "this is extremely Tyrrish."

"What makes it 'extremely Tyrrish'?" He asks, before slowly taking the tops from her, their fingers brush and he feels the contact all the way in his toes,

"The combination, the low cut of the blouse, this is something you'd wear out to a semi-casual event."

She seems giddy enough and he wants to keep her mood heightened, so he pulls off the Poromish tunic and places it neatly on the table, and then replaces it with the soft cotton fabric of the cream colored blouse she picked.

"You seem like a fully buttoned and laced type, but you have a nice chest." Her voice tilts, just slightly off-kilter, like a glass marble across stone lain bricks and that flush from earlier revives itself across her nose and cheeks, "I think you'll look better, and easier to approach, with some of it exposed."

"You're right. I usually do." He pauses, "But I won't anymore." then pulls the laces that keep the neckline taut at the front and they fall open into an effortless lapel.

"I'm not saying you can't—," she quickly adds, narrowing her eyes at him,

"You're saying you think I look better with my chest out," he cuts her off just as quickly, and his voice drops into a deep, teasing baritone,

"I did _not_ say it like that." She says sternly, jaw clenching. Her eyes find his and light up defiantly and he smiles.

"Mm.... No, I think you did."

He pulls his arms through the vest. To his surprise it's more like a shawl and hardly anything to keep warm or serve a purpose, it's just another layer of fabric. There's a single green button with a hoop to secure it and he pulls the them together.

"Am I Tyrrish enough?" He braves teasing her again, stepping back and holding his arms apart for her honest appraisal.

She gives him a thoughtful hum and clears the space between them to pull his sleeves up at the forearms and tie the small leather ties at the edges of the sleeves in intricate knots. Her fingers are deft and talented, and leave him mesmerized at the fluidity, she mutters as she worksl; something about him.

"Huh?"

"Why civilian clothes?" She says instead, and she looks up to receive his answer.

Dain waits for her to take a step back, but when she doesn't he lets himself speak, "Supposedly I'm meant to be a Tyrrish Ambassador after graduation. So I wear military fatigues, but it's no longer required."

"And you aren't picking uniforms?" She interrogates with astonishment weighing on her words. She runs her hands through the length of her ponytail and shakes some loose strands to the floor.

He wants to do that too.

"Not unless Tyrrendor issues their own to separate them from Navarre's military. I don't want the association to my father following me anymore than my genes and last name."

"Really hating Navarre, huh?"

"Basgiath. I hate Basgiath. And whatever else I'm probably going to discover." He admits with reluctance.

"Wait." She gasps, and finally takes that step back that has him internally buckling at the loss of closeness, "You're going to be an _ambassador_? Right after graduation?"

"And a—, er, yes." He wants to tell her he's going to be a flight instructor too, wants to brag in hopes that she'll fawn and swoon, even if it's just a little so that he'll be the one to impress her,

"I didn't know you were _that_ qualified; and what else?" She's testing the water with him quite a bit today. First his space, now his business.

She tilts her head and her long ponytail slides daintily across her back and over her shoulder, "Tell me." she commands with a siren-like air growing about her.

_"Tell her."_ Cath urges from the depths of his mind and almost scaring him,

"And a flight instructor."

"Both?" She gapes,

He nods.

"It's not—,"

"Impressive. Not a wingleader for nothing, I guess." She straightens up and laces her hands behind her back.

He closes his eyes. He fights to tell her how impressive _she_ is.

"Besides the assembly, you're the only person who knows. So..." he plays the statement off coolly, walking away from her and to the pack, he starts taking the vest and blouse off to don Troy's tunic again. He clenches his jaw to fight the goofy grin that threatens to split across his face.

"So, I'll have to call you _your excellency,_ Tyrrish Ambassador Dain Aetos, and _Professor Aetos?_" she wonders aloud, staring off into the distance as he changes.

He glowers. He's instantly rock-fucking-hard hearing his assumed titles play off the fullness of her lips. He shoves his erection into the sides of table, wincing at the unpleasant pressure and thinks about how old Cath probably is and how wrinkly he'd be as a human—

_"Do not deface me!!"_ Cath bites in annoyance, his tail slaps against the cliffside and chunks of rock roll off the edge in the far distance,

"Sounds about right," he grunts, glancing back at her, "Shouldn't I be calling you _Lady Mairi?_"

Which proves to be a mistake because he gets even _harder_ when he pictures that ponytail bouncing above him as he takes her on a padded, cushy chair in whatever office is assigned to him as a professor, pressing her down in his lap every time she pulls off of his length—no. _No_, he actually imagines her laid across the senarium table, on her back with the blue of her irises barely visible because they're rolled up as far as he buries himself inside of her, again and again and again until she cums on his cock and leaves her creamy residue against his hilt.

"I still get called that, here, at home." She snickers, she bares no shame with her title.

Just being able to sit and help her train is an honor in itself.

He shoves the the clothes back in the sack and takes long, steady breath. Then plants his feet in the drained and empty wasteland of his mind, focusing on the bits of dirt and sand beneath his booted feet, and the feel of his and Cath's war flag hanging low at the top of it's pole. He reaches for Cath, who helps calm him, tickling his emotions against the decaying fabric.

_"Because you're in heat... you ground yourself?"_

_"I'm not 'in heat' Cath, whatever the fuck that even means."_

The flag lifts suddenly, flapping so violently the fabric sounds like it's cutting the air as it jerks against itself.

_"My extreme fondness of you is not without your required respect, my Knight."_ the red bellows, effectively checking Dain,

"Right." he says, out loud.

"Huh?" Sloane mutters, she's right there next to him and he doesn't notice when he turns and bumps into her,

"Shit, sorry. I was groun—," he stops, he knows she'll ask why,

"Grounding? Why?" She hardly stumbles, and recovers from the soft impact with ease.

_Calm. Be still._ Dain tells himself. They were having an _actual_ conversation.

"Just... remembered something." He lies, but she takes the bait and he deflates as he walks over to the stone bench with her at his heels,

"What does it look like? When you ground." she sits next to him and immediately pulls her knees up to her chest then rests her chin atop of them while she waits for his answer,

"In my mind?" he questions for clarification,

"Yeah... I picture myself at home. Thoirt's bond always flows to me from Liam's room."

His heart misses a beat and pain ricochets from the pathetically beating mass of flesh to his frontal lobe, and he flexes his hands, he knows she means before the rebellion, when she was still at home with her family the way it should've been.

"A wasteland." he mutters, divulging the scene to her nervously,

She cocks her head against her knees and her hair falls away from her neck, "...a wasteland."

He closes his eyes momentarily. She's just so _divine_, every fucking movement is graceful, intentional, and somehow so simple. Her features are complicated and certainly coveted. He wants to sit on his knees in front of her so she'll be forced to look down at him, so he'll know he has every bit of her attention. So the blue of her eyes will wash over him like cleansing water in Loial's temples.

"Yes." he looks over at her to gauge her reaction, and its only confusion.

"Not like... an office... or tacticians tent?"

His face scrunches at the thought of trying to be at peace in either of those places, "Amari's sake, no."

"Why a wasteland?" She ponders, she's listening to him with invested interest,

"Well..." he looks up at the rock ceiling, "I don't have anywhere that I've ever been able to go to comfort myself. And whenever I did, it was an open space, with not much to look at. Valley's, mountain ranges, lakes... just the usual. I mean, I guess there were some forests but the correlation of Violet having been there doesn't... put me at ease anymore."

She furrows her brow, her opposition obvious, "But aren't all of those places scenic and beautiful?"

"If you go there with the intentions of enjoying the scenery, I suppose." He pauses and looks over at her again, losing himself in the corona of periwinkle grains spiraling around her pupils, "A wasteland is where I met my first actual friend."

A memory climbs to the forefront of his thought, and he quickly closes his eyes to receive it.

"Who would just be out in a wasteland?" Sloane asks, her steady voice tumbling into the reminisce with him.

_"Cath."_ He whispers, as he slips away completely.

---

He's not sure why he's there, or even how he got there, but Dain knows he shouldn't be there. Inherently, even at his age, he knows he has not a semblance of business here in this realm. He looks all possible directions, and every turn its the same, _north, east, south, west,_ there is only rough sand. At further inspection he can distinguish it's not the soft sands that sink between your toes in Poromiel, or the gravelly, rock-ish sand that stabs your feet in Navarre's lakes and rivers, or the perfectly spherical sands that blast across the dunes of rolling deserts. The particles here are simply dead remnants of whatever they once were or could be. The thoughts of what dirt strove to achieve should life once again embrace it.

He looks down and sees he's fully dressed, with shoes, not feeling hungry or thirsty. Above him the sky is overcast and gray. The sun behind the constant cloud coverage lights his way, for now.

He walks, not in any particular direction of for any particular reason.

This isn't the first time he's awoken in some desolate area that a child certainly wouldn't survive, because he recognizes that this place is indeed desolate and he knows he's a child. This is the first place's second time his father has attempted abandoning him. He would eventual tire and collapse from exhaustion, hunger, thirst, or the elements and then he would fall into a tepid subconsciousness that felt a lot like what he imagined flying would feel like—if he could fly. Sometimes it took a week or two, especially where there was foliage where foraging that could be done, but there was a time it took four days and he felt like this time it would be even sooner. He hopes, as he looks around and sees nothing but perilous, cracked earth, that it would be sooner.

Time passes him by and his feet begin to sting.

Time passes him by and his stomach aches as the sky blackens four times over and as the sun blinks into the blurred horizon each day, a red star glints and rises into the night sky, watching him.

Time passes him by and his lips crack and bleed as his throat dries. That red star has wings and it flies in methodical rotations around him.

Finally, his body rings to Malek to collect his soul as he collapses.

But he knows he'll be denied by this God; Malek never wants him, he's needed elsewhere, and demanded by another. Instead he's carried off, caged in the titan claws of a gleaming, colossal red stork to a forest clearing he could recognize with his eyes closed at the sounds of the birds chirping there. It takes a whole day for his body to wrack itself to an operable condition and he stirs to reality in a small creak. He drinks immediately, afraid to open his eyes, but when he finally does he chokes.

Dragon.

Towering stories tall, at least the size of two buildings stacked, still and unblinking while it watches him flounder about in the creek.

"Is it you?" Dain manages, voice shot and missing at certain words, "Are you who keeps saving me?"

He becomes upset when it doesn't answer him.

"Well you should stop. He plans for me to die, not survive."

It blinks at him, _finally_, and he feels relieved because he was starting to think it was a mirage from the wasteland. The giant thing cranes its neck down at him and speaks in a way that he hears it, but not through his ears.

_"No harm will come to you before it does me."_ It chuffs, _"You are mine."_
