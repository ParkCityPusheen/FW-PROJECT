### [Chapter 14](https://archiveofourown.org/works/63478354/chapters/168371290): Dain | Compatibility

There's no comfort to be found in Basgiath anymore.    
  
He can't stand the food, the fake, forced camaraderie flaunted between Navarrian riders, and the pitiful looks the professors cast his direction as he completes his leadership duties.     
    
He'd rather be training Sloane.    
    
Or _inside_ her.    
    
He grimaces as cold water rolls over his body; he'd masturbated at least five times the last _two_ days. At this rate he's going to rub the skin off his cock or hump a hole into his mattress.    
    
_"Mate."_ Cath barks,    
    
_"Goo, aaway—"_ Dain retorts childishly, snapping his head upwards at the shower head as he groans,  
    
_"You block me out every time you do that. Take care of your heat."_  
    
_"I can't just,"_ Dain flushes and blinks water out of his eyes, _"take care of it."_  
    
Cath grumbles and retreats from the forefront of his thoughts.    
    
If he could, he would take care of it. He would kiss her kindly, then fuck her until she couldn't stand the day after. Until her throat was so dry she needed wetting salve to soothe the ache and her voice no longer existed outside of screaming his name. He sighs as his erection revives again and he turns the water so hot he grits his teeth and squints to bare the pain,   
    
_"Stop that!"_ Cath growls,    
    
_"Cath, I love you, but can I please have like... five minutes?"_  
    
Cath flings his feelings of rejection and indignation though the bond before his ruby ramparts settle in their place across the wasteland.    
    
Dain turns the water warm and palms his cock.   
    
He groans again as he recalls precisely how soft her skin was, and how perfect his fingers fit in the dip of her hip.  
    
Gods, he's _fucked_.

"What do you mean we don't need to pursue them anymore?" Imogen asks with raised brows as they walk through commons,    
    
"Cath helped out."    
    
Imogen gives him a stupefied stare.    
    
"Apparently right now was a particularly bad time to cause the dragons the loss of their bonds."    
    
Specifically; the threat of venin becoming so concerning to certain members of the Empyrean, they believed anything that gave dragons the upper hand was a highly regarded commodity. _Particularly_ signets. He had been allowed to listen in to Cath's portion of the conversation with them and he'd barely said anything.  
    
Dain shuddered, "We just need to make sure the others are well aware that they're being hunted, until the weekend. I'm calling the quorum Saturday."    
    
"Why then?"    
    
"I guess there needs to be a contingency on the Empyreans behalf of the lost bonds, and they haven't picked a messenger."    
    
"Wait, this is so concerning that _Cath_ went and spoke to Empyrean about it?" she gasps,    
    
"No... Cath didn't care, but one of his den mates did. He went, then Cath was summoned because I'm the one directly involved."  

It had been Dòrainn, which both surprised and irked Dain because on the surface Dòrainn seemed to get along fine with Cath, but his swordtail wasn't happy about being summoned because of him. He hadn't seen them interact enough to analyze their relationship; or Dòrainn's intent towards Dain.

There were plenty of variables here: one being whether his mother expired after his birth, or if she survived—which seemed...unlikely. Naturally because Dòrainn was there in Aretia, in Cath's den. It seemed more plausible that he'd be with his bond, Dain's brows press inward, in Navarre with _his_ bond.

_"Dòrainn is not yours to ponder over, Hatchling."_

_"You only call me hatchling when I piss you off—are you jealous?"_

He has to swallow his laughter when his swordtail shields in response.

"Well, thanks to both of you." Imogen grins, "Once we get past this we can graduate and be done with it."    
    
Dain furrows his brow, "What about Sloane?"    
    
"Violet's here." she holds the door open for him to mess hall, "And the rest, including Sloane, need to want to survive on their own anyway. It's unfortunate how we lost the last six... but, we can't save everyone especially if they don't want saving."    
    
Dain remembers her small, lifeless body, "I don't think I can disregard that."    
    
"You're worse than Xaden." Imogen clucks her tongue, "Just... don't make someone else's whole existence your issue when you've got plenty of your own. That's an unhealthy habit."  
Dain sighs.    
    
Breakfast sucks.    
    
Toast, and not syrupy, buttery, cinnamon dusted Tyrrish Toast, hard-boiled eggs with the whites gouged and the shells half peeled, and a mystery meat he made himself eat before questioning its origins.    
    
Cat had grabbed him a mug of coffee and set it front of him, but neither of them mad an attempt to drink. Cat looked down at her own mug with obvious respite.    
    
"Are you guys gonna drink it or..." Rhi teased with an exasperated face,    
    
"This isn't _T__yrrish_." Dain loudly sighs in disgust,  
    
"Liquid death." Cat groans,  

“Drink it.” Imogen dares while grinning,  
    
They both decidedly hand their cups to Rhi seated ahead of them when Sawyer sits to his left jabbing Dain’s shoulder before taking a bite of his food, "Check it out," 

Dain looked down where Sawyer's leg was pressed against his own; he'd managed to created some kind of mechanical joint that moved smoothly when he bent his leg, "Do you have to grease that?"    
    
"Sure do," he chuckled, "otherwise it squeals like a pig."   
    
"I feel like you could make some cool weapons." Dain suggested, peeling shells of his eggs with thinning irritation,    
    
Sawyer’s freckled face smoothes over in thought, "You know I've been thinking about that too, but I would need like... raw metal to work with.”  
    
"Why do it from scratch?" Dain countered, "You'd have to refine all of that otherwise it'd crack at the wrong time."    
    
Sawyer took one of Rhi's coffees, "Very valid point."    
    
Sloane and her group sat at the edge of the table, just a few chairs down from their seniors, but making sure she’s close to Imogen.  
    
"I hate this." Sloane whined, "This is _not_ Tyrrish."    
    
"Dain just said that."     
    
Imogen's eyes fired back and fourth between himself and Cat, "First names, huh?"    
    
"He's the one always saying my whole name."    
    
Dain cut his eyes at Cat, "What's wrong with your whole name?"    
    
"It's long." Cat deadpanned, poking her luncheon meat with her fork, then dropping the utensil in disgust. She grabs her braid and rolls the tip of it between her fingers,  
    
"_Rhiannon_ is long." Dain disagrees, inhaling the last egg.    
    
"My name is a whole syllable less than Cat's." Rhi cackled,     
    
Dain says their names in his head, "Wait, you're right."    
    
"This shit food is already messing with your brain." Cat complained, "Please try to not turn into Un-Dain before War Games."    
    
"Are fliers participating?" He asks excitedly, "Wait—who is _Un-Dain,_"    
    
"We're being given the option to," Kai said from down the table, "Sir, you never told anyone how the declarative evaluation went..."  

Dain looks up, they're all looking at him, Ridoc and Maren who've joined in as well, and some of Second Wing who'd filled out the rest of the table past them.    
    
"It went perfectly. Squadron Zero is a go."    
    
The table erupts into cheers and Dain feels his shyness flush across face and neck,    
    
"This is great!" Kai shouts, "You have no idea how monumental this is!"    
    
"He's right," Cat preens,    
    
"What now?" Rhi asks,    
    
"Apparently we're supposed to go on an expedition starting at Draithus and up the north border, then back."    
    
"When?" Sloane asks, leaned forward to see him across several plates of food.  
    
She's wearing her twin braids, her signature look. He fights a smile and his lips twitch.    
    
"About a month after graduation."    
    
Her face twists, "Then what?"    
    
"To early to tell," he replies with a shrug.    
    
"You're blushing." She declares, "Stop that."    
    
Her eyes narrow on him, but there's a glint of mischief there,    
    
Dain groans loudly, "How am I supposed to stop—wait." He takes a bite of his toast, "You're fucking with me."    
    
"She does that," Lynx grumbles.    
    
"Who is Un-Dain?" he asks again, remembering that it was never answered.    
    
...they all just laugh at him and he zeroes in on the wrinkles above Sloane's nose as she chortles into her sleeves.    
    
_Don'tgethard.Don'tgethard.Don'tgethard._  
    
_"This is exhausting."_ Cath exhales, hotly.

During sparring and weapons training Dain weaves through mats, observing challenges half-heartedly. He keeps himself within clear line of sight as he saunters about, drifting from corner to corner with Sloane in his peripherals at all times. She's squeezed between Baylor and Lynx, with Avalynn on the mat ahead of them for her challenge. Dain doesn't care for the physical closeness that's constantly being flaunted between Iron Squad's first years but it isn't his place to disapprove of it—it was only _jealously_ on his behalf anyway. It was kind that settled against his skin and made him sweat, a type that made his gums itch with annoyance. He's desperate for anything that rips his attention away from her and shouting from the corner of the arena beckons him,

"Really?" He says as he rounds the mat.

There's a smaller male, a marked one, of course, refusing to square up against his squad mate—who looks like he can't read and certainly smells like he doesn't shower.

"What the fuck do you want?" He snaps when his eyes zip to see Dain at the sound of his voice,

"Article eight. Section nine." Dain gripes, waving his hand indifferently.

"Shove it up your ass." He bellows.

A collective silence infects the surrounding cadets.

"What's his name?" Dain asks the marked one,

"Fjord Kubic." He tells him.

"You don't look like you know how to read so I'll count to ten, and let you walk away from this one."

Kubic twitches, eyes bulging at Dain's sarcasm, "Yeah?"

He dives for the marked one who barely dodges his serrated dagger; it's slices through an inch of flesh at his waist and he screams while he grabs his side.

"That's a violation!" Professor Emetterio hollers behind them, he's approaching with haste... but not hastily enough to quell the acidic fury that coats his mouth like oil.

Bad breakfast.

Stinking cadets.

Codex infractions.

Sloane is r_ight there_ and he _can't touch._

Something _snaps_ in him. Simple, unrestrained, and Dain unsheathes his shortsword before spinning it in his hands, flicking his arms outward in a forward lunge. Typically he'd lean heavily into verbal correction but he considers the barren stretch of outcomes his words have ever earned him—a whole history of failure—and it's that futility, flaring hotter with Cath’s bolstering in their bond behind it, that drives him before judgment can intervene. The blade presses through the skin, flesh, and bone of Kubic's thick neck like a honed meat cleaver—his body slides onto the mat in one direction, spewing blood over his Wing and Dain, and his head and neck roll to the opposite side, bouncing in front of the marked one who winces before standing up.

Satiation pools deep in his belly as he wipes blood from across his lips and whether it's his or Cath's is blurred as their emotions mix with similar convictions.

He glares down at the dismembered body and thinks back to the satisfying crunch of his fist against Aura's face earlier in the year; maybe she wouldn't have been such a fucking issue afterwards if he had just removed her out of the picture permanently like this.

Iris Drue appears at Emetterio's side, ready to argue but he holds up his sword, pointing its tip at her throat, "I'm not interested in the banter, but if I've committed a violation, please, see it over with the professor and I will happily be burned."

He wipes his sword off on Kubic's body, sheathes it, and makes one more round through Forth Wing before leaving early to shower.

_Not_ because he's covered in blood—and not because he catches Sloane's eyes fixed on him with her bottom lip caught between her lips.

And she definitely _doesn't_ squeeze her thighs together when their eyes lock as he strides past her.

---

He's down two for the day when he re-emerges from the dorms in his sparring uniform to Signet Sparring. There's a buzz in the halls, something exciting to the others, and Dain keeps his chin up and his eyes forward and finds that he's truthfully uninterested in the tight whispers fleeting around him.

He spots the braided, blonde streaks of Sloane's head almost immediately as he clears the top of the entryway, spying on her ahead of him and seated comfortably next to Imogen. She's busy scribbling away in a notebook, studying—an assignment? It doesn't matter, but it does make him _hard_ seeing her so focused on her work rather than, well anything else like her year-mates who were busy entertaining their seniors with dramatized retellings of their day. He couldn't be more certain that Sloane would easily exceed her counterparts if she stayed down the path she made for herself.

"There he is!"

"Fucking finally. Were you beating off in the shower or something?"

Dain's eyes tighten—he _was_.

"Licked the blood of your skin like a kitten?"

Dain grimaces at the top of the steps, "What's wrong with all of you?"

A quarter of the squadron is here.

"Hop in the pit, we're stealing some class time." Daux jerks his thumb at the mat,

Abdullah removes his uniform top, leaving him in the short-sleeved linen undershirt. It's nearing the end of the summer but it's still hot—the runes here were identical to the ones in their fighting chamber back in Aretia, so even in the sweltering heat there was a chill within the perimeter.

"Wouldn't want you to forget how hard you fought to get here. Come down, hurry up." Daux teases,

"If you were worried about proper procedure and such, it's been taken care of. Though I hate to admit we have a highly ranked audience as usual." Lieutenant Colonel Kingston jerks his head to his left, popping a furry blonde brow in disdain,

Dain cuts his eyes to the right.

_Melgren_.

The general stands next to his father, watching with what he could only describe as scrutiny even if his beady eyes couldn't be made out from this far across the mat. He lets his own brows furrow at the flier and Kingston rolls his shoulders—the unit had mastered understanding their silent perplexities, probably due to to life threatening sequences suspended hundreds to dozens of thousands of feet in the air.

"We'll find out later, I'm sure." Kingston gripes, "I'm one hundred percent certain it's because of what's unfolding this Saturday."

Dain begins removing his top as he descends the stairs two at a time as Kingston retreats away from the mat. When he passes behind Sloane he says her name and she glances back, holding his gaze. He drops his top over her and she catches it mid-air without turning fully, folds it into her lap under her studies, and only looks away when Lynx leans over Imogen to ask her something.

"Signets?" Dain asks, "I have my paws.."

Daux affectionately dubbed the slivers of his personally fitted metal braces _paws_. They bent perfectly to Dain's knuckles and the custom slurry of metals allowed Daux to contort them like elongated claws or curved blades as he fought. Thibodaux was a metallurgist and had made some of the most comparatively industrious uses of his signet Dain had ever seen. He'd often considered introducing him to Sawyer, but Daux wasn't fond of Basgiath's cadets and often reminded Dain his reputation was the reason working together was such an easily made exception.

Daux jerks his head at Abdullah, "Lizard talk first. Then, yes, we spar _with_ signets."

He crossed through the wards and onto the mat and began stretching next to Abdullah who leans in close, "_You_ had business with the Empyrean?"

Dain shakes his head, "Cath. Marked ones are being actively hunted in the Quadrant; one of his den mates reported it."

"They overruled Codagh's testimony in favor of Cath." He leans in closer, "We're staying on campus until next week, Gliocas gave me a synopsis of what's going on."

Abdullah probably had one of the calmest, dedicated dragons he's ever met, and Cath trusted him inherently. Dain remembers the friendly flick of Cath's tail the first day the squadron met and his dragon exposing his neck in mutual respect. Dain's face scrunches as they lean in synchronized sloth, bending forwards to grab the tips of their boots.

"What exactly unfolded for Codagh to get involved?" Dain ponders, "And they _denied_ him?"

"What are we whispering about?" Daux mutters, leaning in as well,

"Dragons." Dain answers,

"Well I don't think any dragon being denied by the Empyrean is a big deal; its the outcome of this situation that's bugging me." Abdullah glances to Dain, his grey eyes are skeptical.

"What? In the memory-sharing?" Dain contemplates; asking dragons to do anything for other humans outside of the one they bonded to was unsavory to them, 

"No. They're fine with that if it means some sort of justice. The dragons who bonded to the Navarrian assailants have decided to break their bond."

Dain faulters and Daux reaches up to press against his chest, "Careful." he says,

"They're _breaking_ their bonds because of the hunting?" Dain gasps,

"Not the hunting—the loss of bonds, the _signets_." Daux clarifies, "The Empyrean is pissed that _six_ signets are gone because of the weightless opinions of cadets."

Abdullah nods, "Gliocas said it'll be no different than letting a rider fall to their death. It's... menial, to them. But for humans? That means Basgiath really has to rethink the way they're molding their riders."

Dain grabs his undershirt above his heart, "Holy _shit_."

_"Do not concern yourself with minor details."_ Cath admonishes, sweeping dirt and dust along the wasteland, _"It has been handled."_

Daux nods, grabs Dain's arm and drags him into the center of the mat with Abdullah at their heels, "Yup, big lizards, big mad. And we asked permission from the assembly to board here with you because your and Cath's names are being directly attached to this whole decision. If the upper brass needs to speak with you they go through Kingston first—doubt they will though, since he's a flier."

"That's why Cath didn't bother saying anything when they asked for his side as a witness. They'd already made up their minds when it had been initially explained to them."

"Yup." Daux grunts,

Abdullah shrugs behind them, "I wouldn't have said anything either if I were him, you're plenty capable of handling it and I say you have it handled. What's the toll?"

"One attempt today."

"How'd that go?" Abdullah remarks, smirking; he knows the answer.

"He's dead."

"Good." Daux purrs, "We need to focus on killing venin, not each other, now square up."

"They would've been fried Saturday regardless." Abdullah smirks.

---

"Three days early?"

Sloane levels a glare at him, "I'm here to take notes."

Dain eyes her, suspicious, "On what?"

"You. May I come in?"

His palms go slick and he wipes them on his pants before pulling the door open for her and taking her hand to guide her past the ward. She's still in her uniform but her hair is down, pulled over one shoulder in an impossible sea of gilded strands of silk. As he closes the door he barely catches her scent; sweet, sharp—citrus heavy and hidden floral notes.

"Notes on me?" he parrots as he sits across from her at the table in the corner of the room, dragging his desk chair with him,

"I was watching you spar with the squadron riders, and I noticed something." she pulls open the same notebook she had in battle brief and flips to a divider closer to the middle of it, there's already pages of notes as she thumbs to a blank one,

"What's that?"

Sloane looks up at him and balances her ink pen between her fingers after crossing her legs to the side of the table and straightening her back, "We don't work together like that—,"

She pauses, plays at her bottom lip with her pen, "I mean we _do_ work together, but not like that."

"It takes a lot of... hashing." Dain admits, "Was it the metallurgist that impressed you?"

"Him and yourself, you especially because I feel like anything could go wrong and you'd bare the consequence of injury. For him to manipulate your weapons during a fight that wasn't his is a big risk."

"It's the same for him. In an applied scenario, I let him down, or get taken out, he's got to rework the whole sequence of events and even risk himself if thins deviate from the initial plan."

She's quiet for a minute, then looks up at him, "How did you guys end up deciding you'd be the one to... pair up with him, I guess?"

It's a good question, but the truest answer is painfully vague.

It _depends_.

The squadron was a medium sized unit, seven riders, seven fliers. Seven dragons and seven gryphons. Seven signets applied seven ways amongst themselves and then mirrored with gifts, interchanged and considered every possible way depending on their own weaknesses and strengths. It covered the basis of when and why, who and what, and how; they need to be an evolving force, spinning fully at the drop of a coin—willing to shift directly into what was their weakest aspect in order to keep another in their strengths if it benefitted the unit.

They were a mechanically perfected set of gears; self lubricating, maintaining, and upgrading, but what got them there was trust and transparency.

"We've all trained our signets, gifts and weapon sets together so that we have a never-ending cycle of operations that can be reconsidered at will based on situational viability and integrity. So if Daux can't augment my fighting style which is essentially powerless because I have a mind signet, then being a buff for Abdullah is an option, or Lucian, and so on and so fourth. The reason why never matters, only _how can_ and _when."_

Sloane nods, "Are there other signets that are like yours on the unit?"

"There are..." Dain thrums his finger across the wooden table, "We have a total of five classified signets on the unit including myself, excluding one, we are all perceivably better at hand-to-hand and weaponry combat."

"So you've made a biological catalyst of a unit."

"In theory."

"What would failure look like?"

Dain stops thrumming his fingers, "A hawk with the scribes report."

Her eyes meet his sheepishly, "Survivors?"

"I would hate to survive my squadmates."

She's quiet.

She might be thinking about the upcoming deployment, and if he might or might not return.

"Tomorrow maybe, at signet sparring we could talk about how our squad could function with our signets as well as you and the Captains?"

"Of course,"

Sloane shifts her weight in his seat when his voice trails off, he expects her to leave but she's sitting there, playing with strands of her hair.

His mind devolves into carnal trash as he imagines it fisted in his hand, pulling her head back so he can kiss her while he takes her from behind. They're the perfect heights for every position he wants, on a desk, against a wall, edge of a bed, _fuck_. He steadies his breath, fighting the rest of the thought, but his bed is right there and she's right _here_,

"Did—,"

"I was thinking maybe, we could hang out more." she says at the same time as him, clearing her throat when he stops to let her finish, "Since you said we were establishing a friendship and all."

"...You want to hang out with me. More?"

His mouth is dry and he licks around the inside of it to stop his voice from coming up as breathily as it does, but it pointless. It's pointless, and doesn't help the immediate flip-flopping of his heart either.

Her timing is perfect.

It's the end of the year, final reports and tests are mostly already submitted and administered, his squadron is on campus for official duty and business so his father can't bother him about anything without going through them first, and the marked ones would be gaining a protection that no one could give them but dragons.

He folds his hands over his face.

"You should do it like this if you want to hide your blush properly."

His eyes flick over her as she presses her palms against her cheeks and hides her nose behind her hands; she's telling him how to hide his but is blooming shades of spring pinks herself.

"I didn't realize I was." he admits, melting for that sweet voice she uses, "You've been watching me all day today."

"And you've been watching me." she fires back,

Dain snorts, "You think I'm afraid to admit that?"

He feels his face light up more but she already knows how he feels and his admiration of her shouldn't be a surprise anymore, "Do you know how fucking _hot_ you look? Studying during class when the rest of your year-mates are yapping around you for everyone else's entertainment? You have _no idea_ how worked up I get about you."

"That doesn't sound very friendship-esque of you," she challenges.

She's as red as Thoirt at this point, and her eyes quiver as she fights not to break their eye contact.

"No. It's not, Mairi." He exhales slowly, "We can hang out, test your squad's compatibility and build the framework of how you all operate together. Anything you want—,"

Dain covers his mouth with his hand, scratching at his beard then grabs her hand across the small table,

"But you can't come back to my room and I'm serious." he waits until those cerulean lakes fix onto him before continuing, "You show up here late at night and unannounced again, and I'm going to test _our_ compatibility until you _beg_ me to stop."

Her mouth drops like an anvil into her lap.

"Understand?" he croaks, rubbing his thumb across the back of her hand,

"Yes," she whispers, hushed, blushing so fiercely her face is a single mottled shade of red, "I understand."

He stands up, not bothering to tuck his erection, and opens the room door, "Get out."

Sloane stares at his crotch and then at him, she closes her notebook—that she never once wrote in—and plants a wet kiss along the scar off his jaw before whispering "Good night," and scurrying off into the hallway.

He's at ten in three fucking days and Cath is _appalled_ with him.
