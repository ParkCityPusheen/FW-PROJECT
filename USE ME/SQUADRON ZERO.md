NAME
GIFT (WHEN FLIER)/ SIGNET (WHEN RIDER) 
FLIERS
---
**[KINGSTON: *LIEUTENANT COLONEL]*
mind cleave (can think two singular and complete thoughts at once)

* Served in the Nightwing Drift with Drake Cordella. He's not quick to be casual with people he doesn't know, including other Poromish. 
* He is by the book, like Dain was his second year (he's more willing to break rule currently), and takes everything a person says to heart so he can seem awkward initially.
* Nothing gets past his scrutiny
* Other than being supremely anal-retentive and loyal, he's kind and far from a bully.
* He is as tall as Dain, so about 6'2", has blonde hair and is usually the last to chip in on a joke
* He isn't the fastest or most agile flier (while airborne) but his gryphon is the unit's fastest
* He's tall and lanky with skin not quite as tan as Dain's and is never caught outside his uniform
* Always formal, and I mean, literally almost always.
* First in command when Dain is absent, and second when he is present

**[RADOMIRKA: *MAJOR]*
drownfield (Temporarily suppresses awareness of the flier’s presence to those not directly looking at her)—not invisibility, but an extremely forgettable aura.)

* Has very long, tight, kinky, and large hair that is constantly braided in neat, intricate styles
* She is about 5'9" and has midnight skin, a very beautiful ebony and dark complexion that makes her teeth blindingly white
* She's the flier who calls the end of the shift
* While Mirka is cut-throat and outspoken, she never steps out of line and doesn't care for cushiony social niceties and therefore is the last to be put in positions where communicating higher ranks is involved
* She is extremely protective of Dain because of the respect he maintains with the fliers
* Laughs often in the presence of squadron and pretty much turns into an asocial version of Kingston around others
* She regard ANYONE and EVERYONE with a dismissive onceover 
* Dain has once had she reminds him of Cath

**[LUCIAN: *FIRST LIEUTENANT]*
tilt (micro-persuasion, tilt person’s decision-making toward or away from a course of action)—not mind control, but a “nudge” that can change outcomes in conversation or split-second commands
* Has the exact same complexion as Radomirka; they're from the same area in Cygnisen
* Has the same thick, unruly hair textures woven into locs that he keeps pulled otu of his face with a headband
* He is a notorious playboy, he cannot help himself when it comes to intimacy and often is the first to tease Dain inappropriately alongside Raury
* Extremely sweet, like *so* sweet
* He is shorter than Dain but taller than Radomirka
* Lucian is the units stealthiest flier (while airborne), he also quite enjoys infiltration style missions
* He openly calls Dain handsome, and pretty boy, etc.
  

**[RAURY: *CAPTAIN]*
tether sense (feels the strongest emotional connection in a group and two who (if there))
* Shares a love of spicy food with Dain
* Is shorter than Radomirka
* Has a shaved head and light brown skin and brown eyes
* Often teases Dain to loosen up (because if he did it to Kingston there would be consequences) and about how taken women are to him at first glance
* Bares an extreme dislike of Navarre and King Tauri, though it is known only within the units ranks
* Doesn't speak nearly as much as Lucian, but much more than Radomirka

**[SVEN: *CAPTAIN]*
mumurcall (broadcast a single feeling or urge across a room)
* Sven is unusually tall; about 6'7", and his gryphon is also unusually large (and solid black, and very, very, fond of Dain; his name is Vantaraine)
* He has an oral fixation and is always chewing on some sort of fatty Poromish sweet
* He hates venin and strongly disagrees in treating them at all like humans; he also hates that Dain thinks he can rescue, and consequently "cure" Xaden
* He dislikes Violet
* He dislikes speaking with people he doesn't know and while outright ignore you depending on rank; likes to hang around Radomirka and Don
* Has no problems socializing and is often one of the first to speak after Lucian and Raury

**[GALE: *CAPTAIN]*
deepbind (takes their own emotion and projects it onto another-locks in until space breaks the connection)
* Honestly Gale just wants to have a good time
* He's normally smiling
* Has close to no military bearing unlike the other fliers, and somehow even less than Lucian
* His skin is tawny and he has tons of scars because he likes to poke the bear, so he often fights with Don
* Gale wants to have a good time but that doesn't mean *you* will have a good time because he probably thinks you're lacking and has said it to your face, in front of everyone in the room
* It took him the longest to accept Dain as flightleader not only because of rank, experience, and background, but also because Dain brought the same cocky, irritating energy Gale gave him—now he's fiercely protective of him. While Radomirka will let things slide based on time, place, and occasion, you are absolutely not getting away with any disrespect, *especially* towards Dain.
* He's taller than Raury
* His gryphon hates all dragons, except the ones she works with, and often pushes boundaries with them

**[DON: *MAJOR]*
thread (forms a mental bridge to another person, feels what they feel and respond with her own intent)
* Does Don talk? Probably not to you.
* Holds all Tyrrish in high regard, including Xaden and the assembly
* He like Brennan a lot
* Don loves to fish and suggests ocean-bound missions, and participating in them,  whenever possible
* He infamously encourages Dain to jump off Cath's back into the ocean, and that's how Dain learns Cath doesn't mind saltwater—or being wet with it
* He speaks with his head turned to the side when in public because if he's not speaking to you, or you're not in the unit, you should be minding your fucking business
* Will bite, punch, or slap if you step out of line, no words will be wasted
* He is the best in hand-to-hand combat and weapons; training with him is absolutely fucking terrifying and you better take it seriously
* Professor Kiondra refers to him a lot
* His gryphon is their most aggressive and agitated, even with him
