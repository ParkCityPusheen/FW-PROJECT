SLOANE | CHAPTER 31, HEART

Dain's emotions are somehow just as powerful and overwhelming as Thoirt's.

He's practically a second dragon sharing a space in her mind and subjugating her with feelings that leave her dizzy and shaking. The bond, *their bonds,* plural now, she reminds herself. They hum between the three of them like living things, and Sloane can barely think straight trying to track every flickering emotion that crashes over her while they slip away to his suite.

Dain walks beside her, close enough that their arms brush with every other step, and each point of contact sends awareness cascading through their connection. She feels his wonder, his disbelief, his overwhelming affection bleeding through in waves he's not even trying to contain.

"I'm sure we'll have company so we should enjoy the rest of whatever time we have alone for now," Dain grumbles while fishing in his trouser pocket for the key to his room.

She leans to the side to watch his hands work deftly; he's too tall and broad for her to shoulder peek.

"You keep the door locked when you're gone?" she asks, "With a key?"

He could easily use magic, she thinks, to flick the lock open.

He only clears his throat, sliding the key into the lock in a swift and sure movement, inserting it perfectly on the first attempt, "There's classified documents in here regarding both myself and Squadron. They won't let me ward the room, and the lock isn't a simple mechanism that can just be pulled, either."

Dain glances over his shoulder at her in a moment of thought, then concludes: "I'll make sure I get you a copy of the key this week, before you leave,"

The metal clicking of the locking cylinder pins is hushed as he shoves the door open, pivoting his upper body and grabbing Sloane's waist to sweep her inside, forcing her to enter before he does in a graceful pirouette motion.

"Am I allowed in here with confidential paperwork?" she breathes, gasping after he handles her like some prancing noble lady.

Her back hits the door softly and it slides shut against their combined weight. Sloane wrinkles her nose; *how* is she not supposed to gush and swoon at this man without inflating his ego?

"Of course you are; you can stay here when you're in Tyrrendor. It's more comfortable."

"And if The Siblings catches me traversing in-and-out?"

Dain scoffs, "I'll tell them we're together, that's just how it is."

She doesn't attempt to stop the shocked gust of air that slips past her nostrils.

It's so simple for him.

The way he just... declares it.

*"We're together, that's just how it is."* As if it's the most obvious fact in the world; as if she belongs in his space, in his life, without hesitation or second thought. He doesn't care who sees her leaving his quarters in the morning. Doesn't care about the rumors that will inevitably swirl. Doesn't let the potential judgment of others plague his decisions.

He's not embarrassed by her. Not by any of it.

That realization makes butterflies erupt in her stomach; a swarm of them beating upwards against her ribs until she's breathless with the giddiness of it all. She feels her cheeks flush warm, knows she's probably turning some shade of pink that would make Thoirt laugh, and she can't find it in herself to care.

She's falling for him more and more with every passing second, and honestly what's the point of even trying to stop it.

The thought should terrify her, but instead she's acutely aware of how close he's standing, of the way physical touch between them has shifted. Kissing was already overwhelming before; the bond amplifies it into something ethereal.

The missives in Dain's hands drop, forgotten, papers fluttering to the floor around them as he abandons all pretense of composure. His mouth crashes against hers, greedy and desperate; his hands burn fiery trails down the sides of her waist as his knee shoves between her legs, parting them and supporting her weight as she melts into him.

*"Thank you for accepting us,"* he murmurs, utilizing the bond for all it's worth, 

His thumbs brush across the sides of Sloane's jaw, head angled to the side to conquer as much of her mouth as he can while cradling her head in his hands,

*"Honestly, I'm overwhelmed by all of this."*

Her hands find his chest and she pushes him back, "I can tell," she giggles breathlessly, the sound catching in her throat as she realizes he's shaking.

He holds himself steady against her, wedging her between himself and the wall while he inhales slowly; Sloane feels the bond settle as his breathing evens, that glittering white pathway smoothing from its frenetic flickering into a calmer, steadier stream of wisps. The nervous joy that had been careening through it like lightning begins to bank into embers, his chest rising and falling in measured counts beneath her palms. She watches the tension ease from his shoulders, the way his back expands as he centers himself, and for a moment she thinks he's found his composure.

Then their eyes meet.

His breath catches, faltering on the exhale, and the bond *ignites* between them; all that careful control unravels in an instant as warmth floods through the pathway in waves, overwhelming and unfiltered. She feels the crash of it, nervousness and elation and achingly tender affection all tangled together, burning through her chest with an intensity that steals her own breath away. His pupils dilate, russet eyes going dark and desperate, and she watches the effort of holding still cause him to tremble again.

She can feel *everything* in him wanting to surge forward and devour her whole, but Dain restrains himself to kisses instead, to breathless questions.

*"Is it okay if I talk to Thoirt?"* he pants, eyes sliding open with that delirious haze that overcomes him when they're physical.

Sloane's eyes widen, "That's a question for *her*, don't you think?"

Dain's gaze intensifies, the bond swelling between them as he asks: *"Can I touch you... more often?"*

"You've always been touchy," she teases between his kisses, panting when he bites her lips and drags it back with him.

Dain breaks the kiss only to lead them to the sitting area ahead of his desk; he unclasps his cloak from around his shoulders and drops it over the back of the sofa.

The pathway exclusively for the two of them swells white, overlapping and making her dizzy; it's a simple thread of glistening, white fog-like magic that twists and turns and braids against itself infinitely times over,

*"Do you not want to talk to me... here?"*

He's *pouting.*

Sloane's eyes drag up to his sienna ones, widening when she sees the intoxicating desperation there; he looks like he might beg for her to,

"Should I?" she grins, the smile curving her lips as she nips at his jaw, "Is that what you want?"

*"Please?"*

Dain's eyes are wild with emotion, flaring when she finally placates him,

*"You're not embarrassed by me?"* The words tumble out before she can catch them, flirting with her insecurities out loud, her voice tows a vulnerability that makes her want to curl into herself even as she forces herself to hold his gaze.

Sloane watches him dig into his pockets and remove the glasses cases from them, his arm wraps around her waist to secure her against him as he leans forward to place them on the tea-table just before where they're seated. His arm is long enough to make up for most of the reach and when he leans back into the velvet, forest-green cushions, his eyes are locked on hers again,

*"Not at all, only proud, only humbled."*

She presses her fingers into his hair, sliding them across his scalp and he *shivers.* She feels it in their bond too, the warmth that erupts within him from her touch,

*"You know that Liam and Xaden trained for years before enrollment at Basgiath?"* she tells him, looking away and dropping her hands back onto his chest,

*"I spent most of my time avoiding arranged marriages, learning diplomacy, court etiquette, and household management."* Her voice goes quieter, almost reflexive as the words slip past her lips: "Anything to keep me from thinking I could be like them. My foster family made *sure* I knew I'd only be a disappointment if I tried."

The words hang in the air between them while Dain's expression shifts, his brow furrowing as understanding settles across his features; Sloane feels something fierce and protective surge through the bond.

"Don't," she pleads. "Not right now. I'm not ready."

The bond constricts violently, her panic slamming through the pathway like a storm. She can feel herself unconsciously trying to close it, to shield him out entirely, the white fog-like magic threatening to dissipate into nothing. "I don't—I can't do this right now. I didn't mean to say that. Can we please just pretend I didn't?"

His jaw works for a moment, and she watches him visibly swallow whatever else he was going to say. The concern doesn't leave his eyes, but he nods slowly, lifting her wrists back to his head in silent agreement.

Her fingers settle against his scalp, hesitant at first. The bond between them feels fragile, like spun glass threatening to shatter if either of them pushes too hard. For several heartbeats neither speaks, and the weight of what she accidentally revealed hangs in the air like smoke.

*"We're talking about it tonight,"* he *pouts,* before adding: *"And where's the issue in that?"*

Sloane laughs, but her voice carries a slight edge she can't quite soften, "I'm ornamental, Dain. I'm meant to be docile, elegant, and politically useful."

His gaze lowers to his lap, then flicks back to her face, the intensity there softening with contemplative thought, "Considering your current skill set, I'd say you're prepared for war on two fronts."

When she looks away his fingers find the underside of her chin and he pulls her face down to his,

"It's much easier to kill than play politics." something behind those chocolate eyes shift, and the bond goes stiff,

"Especially when it would be easier to kill them all."

Sloane opens her mouth to speak, to agree absentmindedly in the cocoon of warmth their bond envelopes her in as he speaks to her there, but the sensation is gone—gone completely cold and positively frozen as if it had never been anything but a whipping *tundra.* She goes ramrod straight in his lap, chin still settled against his fingers.

Sloane's pulse kicks up at the keen, clarifying awareness that comes from recognizing a predator in close quarters. She's seen him fight, seen him behead Kubic without hesitation, but this is different; this she can *feel.* The violence isn't circumstantial and suggested fickly. It lives in him. Under his skin. Waiting.

*"What a terrible thing to say,"* she quips, *"keep going."*

Does he realize he feels like this?

Dain shakes his head, *"Politics first Sloane, bloodshed is only ever a contingency."*

Warmth floods back through the bond before she can fully articulate the thought, and he continues speaking as if nothing happened, painting pictures of glory and reinstated households with that soothing baritone rumbling against her forehead.

Dain doesn't attempt to invalidate her feeling of uselessness, instead he spins it for what its worth, encouraging her to do her best in class and flight so that she can maintain a position higher than that of her peers. Sloane listens intently, dropping her forehead against his clavicle as his soothing baritone rumbles through them both,

*"And what about you?"* she finally asks when he's finished,

*"What about me?"*

*"Will you take Ferris... or Mairi when the time comes that you're recognized as nobility?"*

The seconds that she needs to regret saying that aren't granted when he replies instantaneously,

*"I absolutely will not marry you in any fashion other than properly, Sloane Mairi, so you might have to take me as Dain Ferris before then."* Dain sinks further into the sofa and her body molds to his,

*"Then you're considering his offer seriously?"*

*"I've got plenty to consider lately, but yes. Not anytime soon... but, yes."*

*"I'll keep you in my own considerations,"* she teases, words light and playful as they dance around a traditionally serious topic.

"You'd better; here, sit. Let me take your boots off."

She crawls out of his lap and settles herself on the sofa, watching as Dain slowly lowers himself to his knees before her. His descent is careful; she notices how he presses one palm flat against the floor first, bearing his weight there before his knees make contact. There's a tender slowness to it, the subtle shift of his shoulders as he braces himself, the barely-there pause before he fully settles his weight.

He's still far from fully healed.

His hands wrap around her calf, warm and steady, and he begins unlacing her first boot with practiced precision. Each pull of the laces is gentle, almost reverent. She watches the way his fingers work, his palms are callused and careful, strong but soft,

"I heard Squadron Zero's expedition is going to be much longer and riskier than you've been letting on."

He eases the boot free with tender care, sets it aside, then his palm slides up her leg, thumb stroking the arch of her foot through her sock. The movement is hypnotic, and the way he handles her like she's ceramic artisan.

He works on her second boot, and Sloane watches his hands—the careful strength, the deliberate gentleness in every movement. When both boots are discarded, he doesn't move. He stays kneeling there, hands resting on her thighs, looking up at her through shades of sepia, soft and searching,

"Should be two months," he mutters against her padded portion of her pants, "Could be four."

"Hunting venin."

His head shakes, "While within Navarre's borders. In Poromiel we're only observing in hopes to help the Poromish develop a better defensive method. I know it'll take longer to be approved. King Tauri isn't just going to go with the flight plan we presented."

"You still did though; so I'm assuming you think you'll have the upperhand?"

He nuzzles his forehead into her thigh, "Poromiel is Navarre's first ward before their own is how I'll spin it for approval if things continue to not go my way."

She's supposed to be following his logic, and she is, mostly, but the casual intimacy of him pressed against her like this, talking strategy while treating her lap like his personal sanctuary, makes her chest ache with something tender and overwhelming. How is she supposed to think clearly when he keeps doing things like this? When he makes her feel like she's both his war council and his home?

He sighs so deeply his body trembles. Dain's arms wrap around her waist and his hands settle by his elbows and she'd grovel in the seeing him wrapped around her so sweetly if it weren't for the disgust he pushes that makes their pathway separate like oil against water,

*"They're being slaughtered by venin and I have to endorse their suffering in the name of Navarre as if we running head first into the same reality. In the end we'll all die the same if we can't work together."*

Sloane drops her hands back into his wispy curls, running her hands through light brunette strands that part as her fingernails drag against them,

"You aren't endorsing it, you're buying them time," she says quietly, "There's a difference, especially when you're choosing to fly headfirst into the fray with them."

Her thumbs hook behind his ears, pressing gently.

She understands his concern, intimately; the marked ones were hunted the same way Navarre hunts cooperation with Poromiel now. Scorned for surviving. Ostracized for existing. Liam used to tell her stories about the rebellion, about how their parents were labeled traitors for wanting autonomy, for refusing to be ground beneath Navarre's boot while fighting for their right to face the reality beyond the wards. The same machinery of power that marked children for their parents' defiance now marks an entire nation for refusing to die quietly and seeking the help of the only other people with the capability to do so properly; the same people who will die the same way they will.

Dain's disgust with his own kingdom settles in her chest through the bond, heavy and familiar, because she's carried that same weight since the parapet. She wants to live; not just survive the year, not just make it through Basgiath, but to actually live.

She's starting to realize that maybe she doesn't belong to Basgiath's cruelty or Navarre's conditional mercy; maybe she belongs here, with him, building something that doesn't require anyone to be felled first and instead to fight together.

But how can she help him as a second-year cadet?

"I need to be the best Basgiath has to offer, Dain; so that I can use you properly."

Dain's head lift from her lap slowly, and when his eyes meet hers they catch the golden afternoon light streaming through the windows behind them, turning those russet depths amber and warm. She watches his expression shift, something vulnerable flickering there before he can hide it.

*"Fair warning—I was someone else entirely my second year."*

The thought shouldn't unmoor Sloane the way they do; imagining being here with him tonight, settled in these same cushions with reports spread across his lap, glasses sliding down his nose while he abuses margins with his neat scrawl. Imagining that she'll know these small details about him now, ones that only she gets to know. She wants to be here for all of it and Gods that realization hits her harder than any training mat ever has.

She cradles his head in her hands, and their bond swells between them, warm and getting warmer.

Getting unbearably hot.

"I'm sure; I just feel like if anyone can prepare me properly for anything, it's you, no matter what version of you it was."

Sloane see her words hit him like a crossbolt, and she watches his pupils blow wide, feels his sharp kick of *want* and *need* that flares through their connection like a match struck in the dark. His breathing changes, chest rising deeper, and his hands tighten fractionally on her waist. Oh. *Oh.*

She hadn't meant it like that—or had she?

The molten heat racing through their pathway makes it impossible to think straight, makes everything feel heavy and intimate and *inevitable.* She almost forgets whatever point she was trying to make.

*"Oh? How so?"*

Sloane grins, letting him feel her certainty through the bond, her conviction burning white-hot and unshakeable.

"We'll push for the Aretian schoolhouse. Build alliances with Poromiel, the Isles. Official ones with military support. Restore what was lost to families who deserve better. Maybe a crown on for a queen..." She watches his face carefully. "You'll help me lay the groundwork, won't you?"

She means it. Every word.

His breath catches, and the bond surges, his devotion and loyalty, his affection and lust all flooding through in waves that make her dizzy.

She pulls him up to her before he can speak, before he can question or doubt, and kisses him. His mouth opens under hers instantly, yielding and hungry, and she lances him with a heat of her own; her want, her certainty, her absolute faith in what they could build together. His hands slide up her sides, trembling slightly, encapsulating her like a sentinel or her predator, she can't tell.

When she pulls back just enough to speak, their lips still brushing, she whispers into his mouth and into the bond simultaneously:

*"On our wings rides the future."*

She feels his fingers hook into the waistband of her sparring leathers, tentative at first, then determined. She hadn't noticed them moving there but she feels it now, feels the intent blazing through him as he starts working them down her hips. She fights it reflexively. Her hands catching his wrists, the motion half protest and half encouragement but his grip is sure and she's equally willing, her body arching into him even as she squirms.

*"You... are you pushing for Tyrrish independence?"* His voice in her mind is awed; breathless.

*"I'm only suggesting it to the person I feel comfortable enough with to."*

Sloane squeals when he yanks her pants down in one decisive movement, taking her with them, and they tumble from the sofa onto the plush rug below. She's left with her lower back splayed across the couch, legs wide, her hair sticking to the back cushion. The bond explodes into unbearable heat the moment his palms make contact with her bare thighs, calloused and melting hot against her skin.

His fingers catch the hem of her panties and she feels him shake with restraint, with want, with the overwhelming flashes of feeling and yearning crashing through their connection so intensely she can't tell where hers end and his begin.

It's just them.

Only them.

He puts her in the same position he had her in last night: on her back with her knees at the sides of her head, wholly exposed to him. Sloane feels the velvet of the sofa cushions against her shoulder blades, the back rest biting into the small of her back, and the weight of Dain's grip locking her open until the thought of resisting collapses into a breathless ache that ripples through her limbs.

*"I'll give you everything you ask for."*

Her lungs stutter when he presses her thighs higher, the strain delicious, the burn of her muscles a clarifying blaze that throws every nerve into sharp relief. She *likes* it. Gods, she likes it far too much, the helplessness that is not fear but permission, the way his palms bracket her behind her knees like iron cuffs. The realization flares through her and the bond answers with an incandescent surge that scatters coherent thought; she wants to be caged there, wants to feel him lose himself, wants to know how long he would hold her down if she begged for it.

How much harder would he restrain her if she *fought* against it?

The question unravels before she can swallow it: does he like her like this? Does he want her spread and pliant, offered up entirely to him, unable to fend him off even if she tried? The idea takes root and blooms into molten submission, curling low in her belly until she is dizzy from craving the approval she feels pulsing from him in the bond's white-hot beat.

"We *have* to find Xaden, Dain." her eyes roll when his thumb find her clit and he pushes upwards, towards her naval, "We can't win against him."

She presses at him in their shared pathway and the the flittering white fog of the bond explodes into scattered shards of her emotion, of her desperation,

*"Don't mention other men while my hands are on you."* Dain bites, forcing her legs apart and lowering his face to her naval,

*"Xaden is the reason we're going to the Barrens anyway, under the guise that the Reds want to observe the condition of their where their ancestral hatching ground is; though it's also a truth."*

His stare is heavy, bold with newfound anger at Xaden's name and Sloane's belly flops; she attempts to cover herself reaching for herself but Dain bats her hands away and recovers it's place behind her knees once more with growing annoyance. Sloane can't help but want to push more buttons,

*"Think he'll accept that I've chosen you?"* she purrs, eyes locked on his, mouth curving into a provoking grin.

Dain shimmies up to his knees, eyes dragging across her most private parts, reverent and ruthless all at once, and her stomach dips in greedy anticipation as his lashes lower and his jaw slackens, revealing his tongue as he drops down on her,

*"I don't give a single fuck what Riorson thinks, Sloane. Or anyone else,"* Dain growls as his gaze slams into hers, the russet burning down to glacial amber as every trace of tenderness freezes out.

His jaw knots hard enough that she hears the faint click of teeth, and his grip cinches around the backs of her knees until her pulse thunders beneath his fingers. The bond simmers under a sheet of ice as he drags his tongue across her, then pushes her up at her knees, lifting her so he can pierce her aching sex,

*"Well I was just thinking that he might not be so open to—"*

"Sloane." he spits, his voice breaking deeper halfway through her name, "Are you hard of hearing?"

She isn't expecting it when his hand comes swift across the back of her thigh; it leaves a stinging sensation that makes tears sting at the corner of her eyes, and her voice bouncing across the rafted cieling.

Sloane gives him a acidic glare, or at least tries to shoot him a look that doesn't practically ask for him for another, "Don't hit me!"

"Don't talk about other men while I'm fucking you." He barks right back, eyes narrowing, "You're trying to provoke me and its fucking working; I can *feel* the fun your having in our bond you damned minx."

The words barely finish vibrating through the suite before a bruising knock rattles the door, followed by *Catriona's* bright voice announcing that she brought lunch; the sound cleaves through Sloane's pleasure, freezing her in place as panic in her throat. Dain goes statue-still for a single heartbeat, the bond locking iron-cold with sharp focus as his instincts overtake hunger.

Then he's moving without sound, hauling her upright, tugging her panties and leathers into place with ruthless efficiency, the same hands that pinned her now smoothing imaginary wrinkles while his mind floods the bond with steadying resolve meant to drown out her spiraling dread,

*"Fix yourself, Sloane."* he tells her while smoothing his own tunic, *"It's just Catriona."*

*"Just?!"* Sloane hops up from the sofa, shoving her sparring shirt back into her pants,

*"You're letting her in?!"*

The stupid, handsome bastard looks at her as if she'd made some kind of Codex infraction, *"Well... I'm the one who told her to skip class so we could eat together."*

Sloane is shocked; her *Wingleader* advising against scholarly law?

"You told someone to skip class?!"

"I—"

"They have class?!"

"They rotate between Riorson House and the Cliffs of Dralor at their professors' will," one of his hands pull her face up to his and he plants a chaste kiss on her lips,
  
"I'm going to open the door for her now, okay?"

He doesn't make a move towards the door itself and Sloane blinks up at him, "Are you sure? Won't it be kind of obvious that we were..."

"About to fuck?"

Her heart stutters. Is he really going to let Cat in with her flushed and disheveled and his breathing ragged just to let Cat draw her own conclusions? Is this a declaration? A challenge? Not that she particulary minds...

Her face heats, "Gods Dain, don't talk like that."

"Why not? I meant to taste you until you forgot how to speak and then keep you impaled on me until you remembered who you belong to… but lucky for you, you're saved."

His words are a deliberate strike; Sloane’s mouth falls open, heat pulling to the surface of her cheeks. He never talks like this. Never swivels that precise diction into something so filthy. The shock curls tight in her belly, leaving her nodding dumbly because she doesn't trust her own tongue not to betray how much she likes it.

"Don't worry though, I'll get you back for acting out earlier." he tuts before waving his hand toward the bedroom enclave. The door opens, flung to the side with lesser magic, and as it slams against the wall Dain turns on his heels, striding for his bathing chamber,

"I need five minutes." he sighs, before turning around and pointing at them both,

"And *be nice.*"

---

Nice isn't exactly what they are.

  

The two women sit in relative silence as Dain rummages around in his bathing chamber.

  

Neither are passive aggressive enough to avoid the others stare, but Cat's are more curious than anything, and she makes herself at home in Dain's suite before sitting in the chaise across from Sloane.

  

Cat's been in here more than her, though as much as she hates to admit it, it can't be helped. Some part of her childishly acknowledges that if she asked him to, Dain would stop allowing Cat in his room. Reassuring, but also childish. Not that Sloane wouldn't give up being mature for two seconds to stand her ground against whatever Cat might potentially start scheming.

  

Alas, mature was something that Sloane needed to at least attempt to be.

  

She sighs.

"How've you been?" she finally asks Cat after about five unbearable minutes.

  

Cat looks her up and down, and then at the food she's spread across the tea-table, "As good as I can be."

  

There's even the fucking pepper flakes she watched him our over his food this morning. They're just friends; even Sloane would get Aaric the food he liked if she knew better. Not. A. Big. Deal.

  

Sloane nods, and Cat glances from the blonde over to Dain's desk.

  

"Congratulations on your graduation." she finally announces,

  

"I'm not sure if I should be returning the gratuity... but in case I am: you as well. You're a year away from being free of Basgiath."

  

That earns a laugh from her, and Sloane smiles nervously.

"Maybe even sooner if boy-genius here manages to say to convince your King."

  

Sloane takes a moment to consider her sarcasm,

  

"Dain's the cornerstone of the new schoolhouse?"

  

"He and Professor Devera. And surprisingly... One *General Melgren.*"

  

"That's..."

  

Cat only nods with pursed lips, sharing the disbelief.

  

First he stands in as acting General of Basgiath, and now *encouraging* a secondary war college?

  

*"Did you know about this?"*

  

Dain answers a second later, *"About?"*

  

Sloane's head cocks to the side, *"You can't hear us talking?"*

  

*"I'm not Thoirt, Sloane; I can only hear what you tell me."* her eyes narrow when she catches the sound of his rough chuckle from her seat on the sofa, it echoes after the one she hears in her mind.

  

"Laughing at what in the washroom? Must not be healing as fast as we've been thinking." Cat exclaims, eyes narrowing the same as Sloane, she makes a circling motion next to her head with her index finger,

  

*"General Melgren is in favor of the other was college?"*

  

*"I know, right?"* Dain pauses, then adds: *"Cath had me propose him as Squadron Zero's Navarrian liaison this morning too."*

  

*"Are we missing something?"*

  

She hears him groan from the suite, *"Probably."*

  

"He could've mentioned you would be here," Cat waves her hand over the food, "I would've brought some for you."

  

Sloane shrugs, "It's fine, we kind of just ended up here. I can always go eat while you two talk if anything."

  

"It's going to be a boring discussion for the most part; we're making a bunch of curricular theses and suggestions to pass up to the assembly for approval at Basgiath and with the Cliffsbaine Headmaster."

  

"For the new war college?"

  

"Schoolhouse." She corrects Sloane, the bitch, "But yes. Were you here to do some signet things? Training? You seem a bit... *fatigued.*"

The handle to the bathing chamber door rotates downwards and Sloane glances over to it, watching as Dain reemerges completely composed, hair still mussed. Idiot.

*"Tell her we were about to—"*

  

"No," she bites, "Just... y'know..."

  

*"No fun."* Thoirt bubbles to both of them, spearing the bond with disappointment.

  

Dain only sighs dramatically in her head, *"Horrible response; she's going to press now. Enjoy."*

  

Sloane's eyes roll so hard she nearly feels strain from it, *"Gods, if I didn't know any better I'd think this was your best friend."*

  

*"Sounds like you don't because she kind of is at this point."*

  

She caps the emotion before it can spill into the bond, the childish jealousy, *"Still not getting on with Violet?"*

  

*"No, we're fine."*

  

He doesn't provide anymore clarity than that before plopping down on the cushions next to Sloane; so close that she sinks into it with his added weight and their arms press together.

  

Catriona raises a perceptive brow.

  

"How's your brain?"

  

Dain goes for the coffee carafe and a handless, poreclain cup, "It's fine. Yours?"

  

"Better than yours." Cat croons, eyelashes closing gracefully, a newfound smile spreads across her perfect face, "Anyway, I heard about the meeting this morning already. You're alright?"

  

"Somehow." he grunts, "Cath stepped in."

  

"Oh." Cat's eyes flick to the cliffs behind them, "And not *on?* Do they know it's a privilege they're alive."

  

*"Yes, a great one."* Thoirt adds.

  

*"Oh, you're back."* Sloane pipes happily, *"Guessing you went off to hunt? How was it?"*

  

Her Red only seems to yawn out the answer, *"Obligatory."*

  

"How'd things go on your end?" Dain asks this time, they're both eating at this point, and not anything that looks like it came from the kitchen here. Its all Poromish cuisine. He hands her his plate when he's done with half of it, "You're gonna need every calorie you can consume for tonight Sloane; eat it."

  

Cat's eyebrows practically sprout wings and take flight off of her forehead, "Why?" she persists, "What's happening tonight?"

  

*"Either you tell her or I will."*

  

Sloane's head snaps to Dain and he's still holding the plate of food in one hand, offering it to her.

  

*"What? It's not like she has to know. Right? I mean what's the point in even—"*

  

*"The point is that I want her to know. I want them all to know."*

  

Her eyes flutter, *"Who? And for what reason?!"*

  

*"Anyone that speaks to you, knows of you, or exists in the same dimensional plane as you."* his pupils *expand,* *"Because I want them to know."*

  

*"You're not worried that we won't be received well?"*

  

*"By who Sloane? Who exactly are we hiding from? Are you worried about General Aetos finding out? I assure you—"*

  

*"No, Dain. He's the least of my worries,"* her eyes crawl across his lap over to Catriona who sits with her legs crossed and a tea cup nestled between her hands at her lap, *"It's not him. It's everyone else."*

  

He snorts and Cat's eyes narrow on the two of them, *"Your friends? I doubt they'd care for long."*

  

*"And yours?"*

  

*Violet,* Sloane begins to think, Violet and Rhiannon are just now approaching him again in a friendly matter and took for him to nearly die—not even after saving Mira had their odd treatment of him changed. She supposes Sawyer and Ridoc had never had much of an issue with him but it's not like the two of them went out of their way to—

  

*"Sloane my friends all died during Threshing and on the Gauntlet. And the one other person... she deserved what she got too."*

  

She glances up at him, no longer burning a hole through Cat's teacup, *"I was thinking about Violet and—"*

  

Dain's head drops down, and he cranes his neck in disbelief, *"Violet and her friends?"*

  

He laughs out loud and Cat sticks out a hand, snarling "Am I missing something?"

  

*"I'm sorry but when was I ever included in anything involving them unless it benefited whoever decided I was useful?"* he grinds out, voice straining and the bond spreading, breaking apart as his emotions become tight with agitation... and something else she can't quite translate.

  

*"I just thought that... maybe you guys had just hit a rough patch because of what happened with Liam?"*

  

*"There was a strain in our relationship prior to Liam, Sloane. Liam just was just proof I was doing more harm than I could imagine. I've always just been alone. That's why I got so damn—"* he drops his fork in the plate and scratches at his beard,

  

*"—freaked out that she was there. The only friend I had showing up in a fucking death parade. And my worrying and trying to help was just invasive and controlling. Anyway, no. Squadron is fine with you, not that if would be a fucking deciding factor. And Cat likes you too."*

  

"Not much. Just need to finish up what you interrupted." he blurts, stabbing through a forkful of tender, dark meat and shoving it into his mouth.

  

His answer is muted and underwater in the washing of thoughts happening in her head. That other feeling there, wipping around wildly as he spoke; it was *lonlieness.*

  

She'd been so wrong.

  

This whole time she'd assumed Violet's tight-knit group included him, that he'd been part of their inner circle before everything fell apart. She'd pictured him at their table in the mess hall, included in their plans, welcomed into Riorson House like he belonged there. She thought the tension between them was recent, a wound opened by Liam's death and Dain's role in it.

  

But he was never there at all.

  

He'd been alone the entire time. Alone at Basgiath after his friends died. Alone when he split the Rider's Quadrant. Alone while organizing the Squadron while she'd been wrapped in the safety of her squad, adopted by the marked ones who called her family as soon as she'd arrived at Basgiath.

  

The irony of it salmost makes her sick: she'd escaped isolation and found belonging with strangers, while he'd left his only friend and found himself completely, utterly alone. No squad to claim him. No found family to anchor him. Just... solitary.

  

Of course Liam's letters didn't include details about Dain outside the odd relationship between whatever her brother had witnessed between Dain and Violet.

  

Dain had nothing.

  

No one claimed him. No one protected him exccept for Cath, and of course Cath had seen only her treatment of him.

  

The room is quiet. Deafeningly so.

  

*"I'm sorry, I didn't know—"*

  

*"Don't."* His voice in her mind is firm but not unkind, *"You have nothing to apologize for. I'm fine. I have friends, now at least."*

  

But he's not fine, she can feel it in the bond now, it's a hollow ache he's learned to live with. Resignation that he'll always be on the outside looking in, and suddenly his declaration earlier makes so much more sense: "I want them all to know."

  

"And what exactly did I interrupt?" Cat presses, waving her spoon at him after setting her tea on the tea-table,

  

Maybe this isn't just a boyish stake or claim or point to make at all.

  

Maybe he's just tired of being invisible. Tired of being the person people only acknowledge when they need something. A signet to exploit, a convenient body to fill a role. The realization settles over her like cold water: he wants to show them he was finally picked. Not recruited. Not utilized. Not tolerated.

  

Chosen.

  

Heat floods her cheeks because Gods, she should have seen it sooner. Every time he'd pulled her close in public, every casual touch, every unguarded smile. That wasn't being possessive or showing off. The bond pulses between them, carrying that shock of loneliness she'd felt moments ago, and suddenly his intensity makes perfect sense. The way he'd trembled when she accepted the bond.

  

He's not overwhelming or too much, she told him that.

  

"Sex. You interrupted sex. Well, technically foreplay, but we were getting there." Slaone shrugs, finally taking the plate from him, "Nothing we can't finish later. But if you could wrap up the curriculum talk efficiently, that'd be great."

  

His eyes get the widest and roundest she'd ever seen them before turning his head to Cat who leans so far forward on the chaise Sloane lets a giggle slide through her mouthful of food,

  

"That's your *Wingleader.*" Cat croaks.

  

Sloane only points her fork at her, mimicking the flier's gesture from earlier, "Well, he's definitely mine, not to sure about *Wingleader* though."

  

Dain's gaze bounce between the two women.

  

"I guess you're right." Dain and Cat's eyes lock, "Are you well enough to be fucking though?"

  

Sloane sighs; any normal person would've just dropped it, but leave it to Cat to instigate.

  

"His performance was just fine last night..." she bites the tip of her fork and stares into the cieling, "So I guess so. But I don't think he'd pass up the oppurtunity even if he wasn't."

  

Cat looks over at him again with an iquisitive brow raised in shock.

  

"You limped the whole way into town the other night." She accuses, "I'm surprised Cath let you have the privacy."

  

Dain groans, "He didn't."

  

Sloane feels her face explode, "He didn't?!"

  

"Hover parent, as usual." Cat teases, "Anyway, I passed your Wing on the way up here, and Squadron too so I hope you aren't planning for that orgasm anytime soon, Mairi."

  

*"Oh,"* Thoirt sings, *"Tough luck, Love."*

  

Sloane only manages a grin, *"There's always tonight."*

  

"Seriously?" Dain spits, "Can't I have two seconds to myself?"

  

"Is that all you need? Two seconds?" Cat snipes, coiling her dark hair around her finger.

  

Dain's eyes narrow, "Sound like you want to find out."

  

"Oh, please, you couldn't handle me."

  

"That's fine: I don't want to."

  

*"Ouch."* Sloane hums,

  

*"She always has to be better than everyone she's so fucking annoying."* Dain gripes.

  

"Anyway," Cat says loudly, exhaling and falling back into the chaise, "you hadn't cared the last few weeks, not until Lady Mairi here had shown up."

  

"I'm sure you could guess why Catriona."

  

*"Damn is she always on your ass like this?"*

  

*"Yes. And Cath is always siding with her."* His voice pitches a tone of annoyance she'd never heard before until now, *"Thank Gods they can't talk to each other."*

  

Sloane notes to self: *Cath is like Catriona, do not provoke.*

  

There's another knock at the door before Cat can say anything else, but it opens immediately after; whoever is on the otherside is unwilling to wait for permission to enter.

  

It's Sven, one of the Poromish Captains in his Squadron, "Alright Dragon, you've got a fucking line out here."

  

Dain leans back into the sofa, then drapes his arm across the back of it behind Sloane, his face says "go on".

  

"Imogen Cardulo and Maiselle—"

  

Sloane shoots up from the sofa, *"Imogen?"*

  

*"Glane mentioned her rider had been stationed in Luceras."* Thoirt mentions,

  

*"But she's here!"*

  

*"Seems so."*

  

Sloane doesn't remember deciding to move. One moment she's on the sofa, Dain's arm warm across her shoulders, and the next she's halfway to the door, her heart hammering against her ribs hard enough to make her dizzy. She'd prepared herself at graduation—had made peace with the fact that Imogen was stationed in Luceras, that it would be months before they'd see each other, that their friendship would have to survive on sparse letters and secondhand updates through their dragons.

  

But she's here.

  

Dain rises behind her, she feels him through the bond; his amusement, his understanding, the way he's already shifting into Flightleader mode to handle whatever Sven needs, but Sloane barely registers it. Her focus narrows to the doorway, to the sound of voices in the corridor beyond.

  

She reaches the door before Sven can finish announcing the rest of the names.

  

Imogen stands in the hallway with Maiselle, still in flight leathers, her pink hair windswept and her expression caught between exhausted and alert. The moment their eyes meet, Sloane's chest cracks wide open and all that careful composure she'd built around saying goodbye, around being separated, just shatters.

  

"Sloane?" Imogen's voice is uncertain for half a breath, she sounds unsure if she's allowed to be relieved.

  

Then Sloane is moving again, closing the distance between them in three strides, and she doesn't care that there are people watching or that she's supposed to be acting dignified or that Imogen is rigid with surprise when Sloane throws her arms around her neck.

  

"You're here," Sloane breathes into her shoulder, and Gods she sounds pathetic but she can't bring herself to care. "I thought—I didn't think I'd see you until summer at the earliest."

  

"Reassignment, not sure how Violet managed it, but she did." she squeezes Sloane tight, "I'm so glad I can be here, closer to you."

  

"That means—"

  

"And you're in *Aetos's* room? Training during Solstice? Guess he's rubbing off on you." Her green eyes bear the smile that her mouth denies.

  

Until Cat goes striding out of the suite.

  

"More like rubbing on him, and neither of them are getting off now." She waves to Sloane as she strides past some more of the Tandem unit and their Wing, "Hope you like your men busy, cause this one *always* is."

  

Sloane turns away from Cat slowly to face Imogen again.

  

Her face is completely void of the happiness that had been there previously
