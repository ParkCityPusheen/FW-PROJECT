### [Chapter 6](https://archiveofourown.org/works/63478354/chapters/165771529): Dain | Before

Four times Brennan witnesses the atrocities Dain's father commits against him.

But the four are so severe that Brennan remembers the weather, the when, and the what that happens afterwards.

The first time it goes almost unnoticed, but Violet's mom notices he's swimming around in the lake with Vi fully clothed, to include a base layer that was more dangerous than necessary in the near triple digit heat in Anca. Brennan had been sent out to retrieve them, but when they didn't come in, Lillith Sorrengail went back out with him to demand obedience.

Once they're inside, she tells Dain to leave all his clothes at the door, like usual, but his timidness is borderline fearful and he watches his mother spend a whole two hours convincing the boy to relinquish the soggy clothes to wash up and go home.

When he finally does its in the bathroom, and she comes running into the kitchen to drop the almost dry clothing in the kitchen sink at the same time his father arrives home. There's a private, quiet commotion, that's controlled and new to Brennan that happens in the house, and it piques his interest enough that he thinks to ask Dain if he might know anything.

He must be only six or seven, because his back is small and thin, his spine prominent as his shoulder blades that tuck in tight as he cowers in the bathtub. His skin is a motely of blues, blacks, purples, and fading greens and he's shaking so hard his teeth clatter.

Lillith shoos Brennan out of the bathroom and that night it rains and thunders, and storms so hard that Dain is forced to spend the night with them—and the whole week after as the storm worsens with their mother's temper. Brennan lets Violet and him sleep in his room.

"It's okay, no one's home anyway." Dain tells Brennan on the third night.

The second time Violet tells their mother. And this time Lillith is quick to round up Dain with Violet; he stays for five days. Brennan comes home with his father from an extended stay at Basgiath and they discover that all of his fingers had been previously broken and Dain had not, in fact, been away at a boarding school like his father claimed to Brennan's parents.

Brennan hears Lillith telling Asher that Dain had worn riding gloves for all five days until Violet had convinced him to take them off.

They take him to the base mender and mend his hands, because Dain's father wouldn't and insisted they heal themselves.

The third time, the Sorrengail's witness the abuse first hand.

Dain trips over some words in Krovlish in a show of talent to the King's advisors. As soon as their parent's meeting is over and Brennan's parent's are stuck in a conversation with King Taurie to celebrate Lillith's quick rise in rank, he chances Dain being dragged onto a terrace by his father. He grabs Violet and Mira and they shadow Dain and his father.

He watches in horror as Dain is struck, again, and again, until finally he cries out when his clavicle fractures and his wailing is loud enough that the attending staff begin to whisper concerns. He's close enough that he hears Dain's bones _snap_. Brennan tells his father and the fight that results between the two of the men is one their relationship does not recover from.

The fourth time Dain is older, a teenager, and Brennan is home from Basgiath after his first year graduation. They're invited to the Aetos's residence and Asher only agrees to go at Lillith's urging—but it doesn't matter, because when they arrive Dain's father is operating purely through the influence of alcohol, and has him cornered in their dining room. He's covered in welt's from the broached ceremonial sash that his father whips him with.

But Dain doesn't make a sound and Brennan watches in horror with his sisters tucked behind his extended arms as his father wraps Dain up in his embrace and their mother restrains the Colonel.

They're all doing their best to get him on the saddle of one of their horses afterwards while he's bleeding and beaten and rocking in place.

"I don't know where she is, I don't know where she is, I don't know where she is." Dain cries.

He says the mantra like a prayer until he falls asleep after being mended.

But _who_ is she, and _where_ had she gone?

He remembers being asked that question, "Where is she?"

Everyday of every week of every season of every year for years. And the answer was always the same.

But he remembers her now: shining, forgiving eyes, a deep, rolling voice, long painted fingernails, straight, clean teeth, dark brown hair tumbling wildly past her waist. And her dragon... Her very kind, very strange, very metallic, very _red_ dragon.

---

He's surrounded by riders at the table when he comes to.

"Dain you have to fucking stop." He hears Brennan's panicked voice in his mind before it reaches his ears, "Cath is going to fly in here and fucking burn _us_ if you burnout."

Who is she?

Where had she gone?

_"Leave there!"_ Cath is smothering him in anger and fear and desperation and confusion, _"You will come back to me now!"_

He hears that strange warbling his dragon makes and it shakes the floor to ceiling windows of the mess hall, the sound of the trembling glass plucks him from Brennan's memories and he shoots up from his chair so quickly its screeches behind him and crashes onto the floor. He jumps at the sound and grabs the hand that was holding Brennan's, he realizes he's sweating so badly its dripping from his hairline and into his eyes.

He opens his mouth to speak but his throat is dry.

He raises his shields so he can think outside of Cath's rampaging.

_"I'm here Cath, it's okay."_ he manages,

_"It is not 'okay'!"_ He roars, _"You do not go where I am not!"_

Cath's own memories of Barlow and his father's recent assault on Dain pillage his mind from Cath's half of the wasteland. The sounds he's making has them all on edge: that synthesized, echoing scream.

"Dain?!" Brennan shouts, right in front of him.

His head snaps up.

"Yes?"

"Fucking sinners, man." Brennan takes a breath. "Please tell me exactly what the fuck you saw."

Dain feels his complexion pale, "Do you... have something to hide?"

"Don't we all?" Brennan replies quizzically,

Dain wipes his face, breathing deeply, "Four times..." he begins, he's shaking and he can't do anything about it, "He broke all of my fingers when I was ten and refused to have a mender attend me; that was the second time."

Someone gasps at his left, when he turns he sees it's Mira.

"The third time, he beat me for stuttering in front of the King's advisors. He broke my clavicle and our dads got into a fist fight."

Cath explodes in a torturous wave of shrieks that makes everyone cover their ears_._ Dain shakes harder.

"Okay that's enough!" Mira hollers, "Did you go fishing through Brennan's head for information about yourself?"

"Yes."

"Dain why would you ever want to see your abuse from someone else's perspective?" She swings him around to face her by placing her hands on his shoulders, her face is warped with pain and disapproval.

"I don't remember it happening Mira." he says softly.

"What?"

"I don't remember some things." he repeats,

She guffaws and snarls, "Good! Fuck him. You don't need those memories Dain. Look at you. Please, can you... tell Cath to relax?"

_"You will not go places that I am not! You must not stay places where you cannot return to me! No, I will not relax!!"_ Cath is screeching through his mind and he winces as the glass windows vibrate dangerously, he can't really think, can't really process...

_"I will tell you when I'm intentionally using my signet from now on—,"_

_"Provide an oath! Now!"_

_"I promise: only when I tell you from now on."_ He coaxes, gently as he can.

Their wasteland returns to its usual state at abnormal speeds from a blackened, ominous coloring; he's learned nothing placates Cath faster than a promise.

_"You will train your signet."_ Cath spits in finality before breaking down Dain's pointless shields with impressive speed, _"You will not hide from me today."_

Right. Shielding meant "hiding" to Cath. But only when Dain did it, most rider's dragons would kindly fuck right off because what do they care—Cath? It meant Cath was in every available corner of Dain's mind immediately, or whenever he managed to pillage his ramparts. Occasion meant nothing to his red swordtail, and privacy was something he had little of. Even when he had sex, or touched himself, Cath was there, watching, listening, curiously and patiently, quietly.

"I'll even go lay down. I'll go right now." he says, he looks where he thinks Cath's eyes are at the distance; he might not be able to see his Swordtail's face but he knows Cath can see his clearly. He gestures convincingly as he can to the dining mess exit through his staggering tremors. The riders around him look flabbergasted as he speaks to his dragon as if he's on punishment.

_"Yes! You will!"_ He heaves, voice grating at his throat as it lights up with potential dragonfire, he's now hovering just outside the dining hall, the beating of his wings don't shake the glass even though they should, _"You will not burn irresponsibly."_

He groans knowing Cath is going to bitch until tomorrow morning. Wonderful.

"I'm going to rest for a bit, I'll be back down for battle brief."

"We'll hold off until tomorrow to talk to everyone about the new formations." Brennan tells him with a raised eyebrow.

"Right." he nods and walks uncomfortably back to his room, he's fucking soaked, and it feels like it's two-hundred degrees in Riorson House.

---

When Dain stirs awake he immediately feels the warmth of another body against his, and he rotates as softly as he can to identify them. To his unpleasant surprise it’s Sawyer, sleeping soundly, and otherwise completely unbothered with his mouth hanging open in an unconscious trance. Over his shoulder Dain notices his roommate sleeping just as peacefully, with Cat and Maren impossibly curled up at the foot of his bed, before them on the floor Sloane, Lynx, and Baylor are crushed up against the wall by his bedside table with Matthias, Ridoc, and Violet sleeping in between their beds, and four of the fliers who participated in the riot drift flight formations at the door. There’s no way to get passed any of them, or out of his bed without waking at least one person up.

_“They will miss the large class.”_ Cath announces, Dain can tell his red’s been waiting for him to wake up.

Irritation spears his mood as he pushes Sawyer to the edge of the bed, gently, until he rolls off and right on top of Ridoc. His metal prosthesis hits the floor with an abrasive clank that wakes the rest of the room up all at once.

“Why the fuck is fourth wing not in class?” He pans over to the fliers at the room entryway as he pulls himself up to his elbows,

“Had to make sure you were okay you asshole.” Sawyer yawns, rubbing his hip and rolling off of Ridoc—who doesn’t even flinch at the impact,

"Just making sure the _squadron leader_ wakes up. I don't wanna be near a dragon if it's not yours." one of the fliers groans, he's got his boots off and no socks underneath. It's Lucian, who's skin was impossibly smooth and dark, with light brown eyes and wide set smile.

“And I’m fine. Go. To. Class.” He manages to get out most of it, but his sleep thickened voice drags the syllables together like gravel,

“We will,” Matthias begins, her head sliding down Violet’s side as the smaller rouses awake, “Soon as you shower and get dressed to go with us. Class just started.”

She raises her finger as the floor attendant rings the last last hour indicator, and the sound of the copper bell tolling wakes up Ridoc.

“Hurry up.” Cat huffs, blinking her dreams away.

Dain rolls his eyes, and with sloth speeds he picks himself up and out of the bed, stepping over Sawyer, and Ridoc, and then two of the fliers as he reaches he and Troy’s shared armoire.

"Matthias as a section leader you should know—,"

"Yes sir, wingleader Aetos. Please excuse this minor infraction. We were just worried about you." she salutes him, and collapses back on top of Violet, who he glares at. She just frowns and shrugs, playing with the end of her braided ponytail and feigning silence as the armoire door creaks open.

“Fuck.” He wheezes.

“What?” Troy huffs, barely awake, “Laundry is done tomorrow night.”

“Doesn’t matter,” Dain sighs, turning to the flier, “I have no more uniforms.”

“How?” Troy grimaces, stretching and pushing Maren off the bed doing so.

“Forgot to grab more when we left Basgiath, and I only have the two here.”

“Sounds like you have plenty actually.” Troy smirks, ruffling his dark green hair,

Dain rubs his hands down his face and grabs his towel out of the armoire before leaving for the washing chamber down the hall. He undresses there, face screwing up at the scent of his sweat permeated into his skin and the uniform, and gets in the warm jet of water from the aqueducts. He stays there, letting the water soak into his sore body for longer than he would usually.

_“I don’t have anything to wear.”_ He complains to Cath.

_“You cannot ask for one of theirs?”_

_“I could but I’d rather not.”_ He admits, _“Clothes aren’t something I like sharing.”_

Cath just chuffs into their wasteland.

When Dain returns to the barracks room Violet is sitting on his bed with Sawyer, and she reaches out with a folded set of clothes.

“They’re Xaden’s but they’ll fit you.”

They do, mostly, the shirt’s just a bit larger in the shoulders and hang lower against his biceps, and the waist of his pants fit sloppily and hang suggestively so he secures it with his belt, pulling it tighter than he usually does. The extra length in the legs gets tucked into his boots so it doesn’t matter that they drag against the floor as he sags back onto the bed to put his socks on next to Violet. He catches the unmistakable scent of mint against the fabrics.

“Damn. Riorson’s only a bit bigger than you huh?” Ridoc drawls,

Dain shrugs, “He’s got a few inches on me, and I’m not holding my weight lately.”

“You guys are almost the same size at a glance sometimes.” Cat adds,

“Doesn’t matter, you’re both unnecessarily large.” Baylor groans from next to Sloane… who’s watching him change quietly. Baylor’s about the size of Lynx, who’s only an inch or two taller than Sloane.

“Let’s go.” Dain commands as he steps between the fliers, holding the door open and gesturing to the hall.

They reach the theatre and Violet stays behind, “I’ve got to go see Lewellen,” she says, “So I won’t be in class. But I wanted to tell you that we should really sit down and discuss all the things you brought up. And whatever happened with Brennan this morning."

Dain nods, Cat glides past them and he moves to file in last, “That would be nice.” He tells her.

“Alright, I’ll be around then.” She smiles and heads down the great hall.

“Wingleader Aetos.” Brennan says next to Kiandra as they file in for Battle Brief, “Feeling better?”

Dain scratches his jaw, and spares a moment to stop before passing the dais, “They decided I needed a watch, sorry for the tardiness.”

“No harm.” Brennan smiles.

During class they discuss geographical topology and using it to their advantage with properly considered flight formations, as well as using the surface with the gryphons ability to cover expanses of land in the blink of an eye. Cat is seated to his left, picking nonexistent dirt from her nails again but otherwise listening, and Sloane is fidgeting at his right. He cuts his eyes at her and she immediately notices, their eyes gravitate together and she leans the opposite way to talk to Lynx.

“Mairi.” Dain begins, “I need you to focus.”

His throat is still dry, he clears it twice but it doesn’t really help for all the noise he makes.

“I was asking him for his pen.” She whispers, staring down at her notebook.

He tilts his to the right, offering it casually.

“Thanks.” She blinks. To his surprise she takes it then flips through her notebook—which is full of what seems to be surprisingly detailed notes.

He reaches over and takes it from her. They’re _very_ detailed notes, she’s even documented some of the dialogue that happens in class and towards the back has cataloged her peers, by wing, section, and squad as she interacts with them. It includes signet, and theoretical weaknesses. She’s made anecdote of who she’s been up against in sparring and weapons of interest. There’s several pages regarding flight tactics and maneuvers, bullets with advice she’s received from her dragon. He smiles when he sees a small box full of Codex infractions she’s been scrutinized for: uniform regulations, military bearing, tardiness, loopholes. He titters softly, and tenses when he sees her hand grab the corner of the notebook, expecting her to snatch it away, but she doesn’t. She slides it so the spine splits between their legs and a page rests on his thigh and on hers. He chances a glance downwards at her and she’s staring right back up at him.

“I… need to train my signet.” She whispers.

_“As do you.”_ Cath reminds him aggressively.

He rolls his eyes.

_“I’ll find someone my year to do it with.”_

_“Yes. You will.”_

Gods, he was insufferable sometimes.

“Never mind, sorry for being annoying.” Sloan bites, sliding the notebook back into her lap entirely,

“I wasn’t rolling my eyes at you. Cath is hovering.” He tells her, grabbing the notebook before she can really get it anywhere,

“What’s he saying?”  She mutters,

Dain glances down at her, it’s nice to hear her voice especially when she isn’t screaming at him.

“That I need to train my signet.”

She flinches, “Who would you train with?”

He sighs and sinks into his chair, his legs spread open more and brush against Cat’s, “I don’t know. Someone who’s lived a pretty by-the-book life. No one really wants to be analyzed in ways they can’t proctor.”

Sloane’s quiet for a while, “I never thought about you needing to train your signet.” She admits; they make eye contact again.

“No one does.” He retorts.

Her eyes are a blue he hasn’t seen them before today; almost navy with an explosion of silver and slate grey hues that are flat and swirling in impossible speckled waves.

“Probably because everyone thinks you’re just good at whatever you need to do.” She shrugs.

He moves to put his bicep along the arm that he and Cat’s chair share, leaning against it to rest his cheek on his fist after he bends his elbow, and scooting farther into his seat, “Would’ve been easier to have a more generic ability.”

He’s comfortable and could fall asleep again at the sound of the pens scratching across paper and Brennan’s voice projecting over them in a steady hum. Sloane’s own breathing and the wafting smell of grass from her person burying into his mind. He yawns and his body shakes until it's finished.

He's fully relaxed.

“What happened this morning.” She asks carefully after taking a few more notes.

Dain pauses for a moment, yawning, hoping to erase the tempting flutter of rest coating his eyes, “Basically trained my signet.”

“I heard the Sorrengail’s arguing that you almost burned out.”

He watches her write.

“I guess. Can’t tell when it gets bad.” He admits to her, “Can’t tell what’s happening around me when traversing someone’s memories now. But then again, I went pretty far back in his and should've expected it.”

“Who’s?”

“Brennan’s.” Dain nods at the oldest Sorrengail down at the dais.

“Why?” Sloane wonders, following his gaze,

Dain hesitates, long enough for her to refocus on him and tilt her head in curiosity, “We have some mutually shared experiences from our childhood… But I’ve lost those specific memories. So I asked him if I could have them.”

“You asked if you could have them?” She repeats, taking notes when he taps the notebook absentmindedly,

“Mm-hmm.” he yawns again.

“So you can just look for specific memories?” She begins again,

“When the person is willing, normally, yes. But I can’t control whatever else surfaces. You’ve got to be pretty solid at shielding to keep me down the course I’m supposed to go. Otherwise everything is possibly a book for me.”

Her eyes widen, “Must be why it’s so hard to find people to train with.”

“Exactly why.” He grunts.

“I get it.” She says, “It’s like when people call me a venin. No one wants me to touch them.”

He lifts his head and narrows his eyes at her, “_Who_ the fuck is calling you a venin?” He snarls, rather loudly.

The idea of her being verbally assaulted in such away makes his goddamn lip curl.             

“It’s fine. I don’t think about it anymore, not since Ridoc’s dagger.” raising her head proudly.

“Mairi…” He looks over at her and she meets his gaze with her own, “Don’t tell anyone about that, yet. Okay?”

She shuffles impatiently, “I know. We need to figure it all out before we let anyone know what I’m capable of so I’m not…”

“Targeted and forced to participate in Basgiath’s bullshit like I was.”

Her mouth snaps shut, but then she speaks again, “I was going to say a liability.”

“You’re not a liability. You’ve never been. You might end up being the turn-around in this war. You’ve proved you’re a necessary component plenty of times already.”

She breaks their eye contact as her face adopts a deep shade of red and a sharp pain shoots up his side, he flinches and sinks into the chair more.

Cat turns to him, jabbing his bicep, “Spread your legs a little wider Aetos, I don’t think you’ve claimed enough space.” She hisses, jerking her chin at his leg. He’s infinitely in her space now that he becomes aware of their proximity; his brows float upwards, and he does what she says to appease her.

“You’re annoying.” She bites out, pulling her leg from against his as he sinks even farther into the chair.

He grunts dismissively and looks back at Sloane who’s watching Cat with so much unfiltered rage it makes him sit up a bit.

“You’ll train me, right?” Sloane nervously mutters after refocusing, “Even though you’re upset with me.”

“I’ll train you.” He’s not upset, he's disappointed but it does him no good to tell her that, “Just not tonight.”

---

Dain mentions training Sloane to Violet a few days later. He explains that wants to do it somewhere not entirely private, but also an area where regular traffic won’t be a distraction. She suggests the terrace just before Riorson and hers room on the familial quarters. It’s quaint, and situated beneath a jutting piece of cliff that creates a makeshift ceiling of rock. The terrace could fit about two dozen people comfortably, and has two separate seating areas with tables and a cushioned stone bench that faces the wooden double entry doors. Dain’s been rather uninvolved in classes and the sort, they’re authorized absences and he leans heavily on his executive officer, section, and squad leaders for balance as he transitions into whatever the assembly has planned for him. He feels sickly about their inclination to include him in politics and other officiate business, rather than the battlefield, but his signet doesn’t make him anything progressive during war-efforts. He throws himself into the flier and rider relations, and flight formation efforts where he feels that he can compensate and directly influence their position in the war.

Brennan and Kiandra call the new paradigms tandem formations those designated that include the combined aerial efforts of gryphons and dragons are dubbed “squadrons”. Riders in riots, fliers in drifts, and now combined in squadrons who fly in tandem. King Tecarus and Taurie approve of the new addition to Tyrrendor’s military tactics and will encourage Basgiath to do the same if next weeks evolutions go well. There’s no word of Aaric's success in appointing himself as Tyrrendor’s Navarrian ambassador, but Dain keeps his optimism firmly placed. Violet explains to himself and Brennan that there are provincial priorities that must be addressed before anything involving venin to maintain the defenses and integrity of Aretia as they move forward and that the assembly finally agrees unanimously with a decision she’s made herself.

At night, every night, he decides to search for memories within himself of his mother and Cath.

And Cath _knows_.
