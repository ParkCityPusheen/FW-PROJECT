No one, not a soul, should ever trifle around the inside of a dragon’s mouth—less it be their final day on earth via digestion.

Yet—Dain Aetos has now, _thrice,_ crawled into his Red swordtail's.

Why?

Because he has to retrieve his graduation gift from the fleshy canal of Cath's mouth because it is, in fact, an actual fucking _rock_, and it's stuck in his teeth.

He stares at first, in disbelief, when Cath’s mouth drops open wide like a string puppet, his lower jaw slamming into the cave floor with a rumbling clap and his upper lifting dreadfully slowly. His canines curve inwards, and as Dain steps over his sharp incisors—that reach nearly to his thighs—he shudders,

_“Past the sharp ones.”_ Cath grumbles.

_“Is this necessary?”_ Dain harks, face puckered at the scent of dragon breath trapped within the cave from his mouth.

Cath only grunts.

He looks at Cath’s premolars, double-takes seeing they aren’t any duller than his incisors, and steps fully into the Red’s mouth. His boots sink slightly into the slick muscle of Cath’s tongue, the surface warm, pulsing, and disgustingly slick—like stepping into a forge wrapped in flesh.

_“Be careful.”_ Cath warns; his fret and worrying flutter within the wasteland before the bond heats with it entirely, _“Do not hit your head, it is soft.”_

_“I’d have to be like,”_ He glances up, blinking rapidly when Cath’s tongue bulges ahead of him, it’s almost forked and just after it he can see the tube that travels up the swordtail’s esophagus for fire-breathing,

_“I’d have to be about twenty feet tall for that to happen.”_

Cath growls, _“Stop playing around in there—I tire of this.”_

_“I don’t want to touch anything Cath, ugh,”_ he feels his eyes watering and nausea rolls over him when he spots a collection of cracked, ground, and snapped bones buried between his first set of molars,

_“Can you tell if it’s on the left or right side of your mouth?”_

His sides throb and Cath’s jaw closes slightly in reflex, _“Why are you in pain?”_

_“My upper body isn’t healing well still—can you tell Dòrainn to not do that?”_

Cath’s tongue raises and nearly knocks him out, _“Tell him not to do what?”_

Dain glances back; outside of Cath’s mouth he sees only the golden eye of his mother’s dragon, claustrophobia pricks him and suffocates his flight instinct. He’s inside of a dragon’s mouth, with another staring into it.

This is fucking terrifying.

_“Left side,”_ Cath declares when Dòrainn’s eyes disappears from the entrance of his mouth. Dain is quick to rush ahead, his hands sliding across the backside of Cath’s teeth for support.

He wishes he’d a mage light rune to search around properly when Cath opens up impossibly wider. Fresh air and light flood the cavern of his mouth and as Dain's perspective clarifies he spots a glinting light farther back against the line of his first molars.

_“Oh,”_ he pipes, _“I think I see it!”_

He gags as the tang of bile, blood, and burnt meat coils in his sinuses. Amongst more of bits and pieces of hunted and mostly digested, hooved mammals, Dain finds a blood red stone and quickly disembarks with it.

_“Do you like it?”_ the Red asks, closing his mouth after his rider feebly steps past his lip,

_“…Well…what exactly is it?”_

Cath’s slitted pupils slide slowly to the left, expanding as they rove over Dòrainn, then settling back on Dain,

_“A ruby.”_

He rotates the chunk of ruby, about the size of his _head_ and it's quite heavy, while eyeballing the dirt and grime nearly completely washed away and shining in droplets of dragon saliva.

Saliva all over his hands, clothes, and boots. _Gods,_ the smell.

He gags, again.

_“I did not mean to nearly swallow it. It is small, rolling around in my mouth like dirt,”_ his swordtail drops to the rough, stone-hewn floor and his body mass kicks up a gust of wind that makes Dain squint as his scaled body settles,

_“No… this is huge Cath. Where did you even find one this large?”_

Cath’s eyes flare and his jowls drop, exposing gums as red as his talons and Dain self corrects immediately.

_“No—never mind, I meant to say thank you—I…”_

He looks up to Cath who rests his head along his clawed feet, watching Dain with calm eyes.

_“Is this because of the banking thing?”_ Dain asks, voice cracking internally,

_“Yes.”_ Cath blinks slowly, _“You cannot hear the inside of my mind, or feel as my body aches, or pains; but I can always feel the emotions and pains you hold—of your heart and mind, of your body.”_

Dain nods, and Cath continues; Dòrainn shifts close to Cath, the sounds of their scales rubbing together make him shiver,

_“The concept of—”_ his voice becomes heavy with irritation, _“monetizing—offering stone and metal to sustain oneself is absurd. Your kind calls hunger a fair transaction. There will be no more of this—you shall eat as well as I.”_

_“Cath I think I’ll be detained and questioned if I bring this to a jeweler.”_ Dain says it lightheartedly, jokingly, but Cath’s eyes narrow and Dòrainn shoves his snout against Dain’s side—effectively launching him meters across the den.

He feels the motion before the pain. His ribs catch somewhere in the arc of the push, and by the time he hits the ground—hard, ungraceful, and breathless—there’s a slow, crawling throb threading through his left side. The air leaves his lungs on impact, not violently, but all at once, like it’s been coaxed out of him by force.

Cath’s body swivels, tightening then nipping at the elder.

Dòrainn’s tail curls in, his body coiling tighter than before. He dips his head and snaps—sharp but not aggressive, a mimic of Cath’s reprimand. It’s the closest thing to “I’m sorry” he can offer, or at least that’s what it seems like.

_“His mistake.”_ Cath growls.

He groans before attempting to move, sluggish to his feet and lightheaded from the speed of it all. His body aches unnaturally as Dain picks himself up from the floor, gripping at his torso before recognizing the wet feeling beneath his tunic,

_“You’re bleeding.”_ Cath bites, and his head swivels to Dòrainn who shrinks fractionally and lowers his head to Dain again,

_“What’s he saying?”_ He asks Cath while rolling up the tunic, and untucking the thick undershirt beneath.

He’s bleeding yes, not badly yet; his sutures are ripped along the left side of his body where he slid across the cave though. He should be writhing. But he’s not. It takes a moment to register why—until he remembers the dosage Brennan insisted on. Gods. Of course. He’s still fogged with painkillers. Dain sighs; Brennan is going to have him on med-arrest for this again.

So much for exploring Aretia.

Dòrainn expels a low growl at him, and is now on the other side of the opening they all stand in,

“It’s okay Dòrainn I—”

Cath snarls, _“He says if they harm you they will never see such a piece again.”_

He smiles at Dòrainn before turning back to Cath while pressing the undershirt against the wound that bleeds the most, _“Do you think you could get Nino to help me out of the den?”_

_“Marbh is on the way with the mender.”_

Dain exhales, glancing down at his drenched clothing, smelling of sulfuric saliva and long-dead cattle, _“Right.”_

Brennan was going to cuss him out, no question. Probably while peeling off the layers of spit-soaked fabric and lecturing him about discretion, restraint, and whatever else he’d forgotten the second he stepped into a dragon’s mouth.  
  

---

“Something’s wrong.”

Cat stares down at him, eyes calm but worry weaving its way against her facial features.

“What is it? Is this uncomfortable?” Her voice lifts, and she moves against the couch cushions,

Dain rises with her regardless, “No. No—lately I…”

“You what?”

He can trust Cat.

He knows it, especially now.

He watched her take care of him in the ruins of the admirative building—Cath shared that memory—he listened to her fiery defense for him; Cat was a true friend. Unexpectedly, but reliable, dependable, _honest._

Dain sits up entirely, lifting his head from her lap where she had suggested he place it after first convincing him to lay across the couch while training their magic. He winces midway and she reaches out to hold him steady at the chest. Catriona opened up to him about Trager and he listened, cracked open at the ribs as she quietly cried through their history, their extensive youth together, and their sparking romance.

Snuffed out as quickly as it rose.

“I think the second day of me being in Aretia, I regained my consciousness to a certain degree. Honestly, between the painkillers and my condition at the time I couldn’t really sense what was happening or _who_ I was.”

Cat pulls her legs onto the couch after kicking off her boots; she’s in civilian wear, Poromish ones. A simple heavy tunic—espresso brown in color with a pair of form fitted pants a few shades lighter, she wiggles her socked feet and combs through her dark, unbound hair.

Lately flier's spent most of their time training in the sparring gyms, flying in the valleys, and helping the relocated migrants settle within Aretia and the growing villages at its outskirts. He'd hobbled along after riding horseback into town with Iron Squad's fliers once and was received with warm welcomes and teary eyes by the misplaced families.

Right now, Cat’s some of the most relaxed he's ever seen, besides while walking along the beach in Hedotis with Trager.

“Who you were?”

He nods, “I was reading memories. _Everyone’s._”

When she doesn’t say anything, just leans back against the couch cushions and tips her head to one side he continues.

“I saw fleeting things you know, _constantly,_ but then it started becoming more invasive—the more I wished to not uncover parts of people, the more easily I was tearing through them. Eventually, I think after four or five days I realized I was subconsciously fighting it so hard I had pushed myself to burnout each time.”

“Lieutenant Colonel Sorrengail told us after the first few days of you being under that you were suffering from fever.” She pulls at the ends of her hair with her nails before glancing up at his face, “So it was actually you burning out?”

“Yes.”

Dain could recognize burnout in himself immediately, typically, not including a few incidents—like with Brennan’s memories—so even in his hazed state he was able to adjust.

Cat straightens up, “Well, what’s wrong?”

“I can’t fucking stop Catriona. If I stop shielding for even a minute, I’ll wield.”

She blinks, “Won’t you… eventually burnout for that?”

Her face shrinks into a grimace then she reaches ahead of her with open hands, “Wouldn't you literally burn out every day from doing that? It would be practically unavoidable.”

Dain nods, “You would think.”

“Just how much magic,” she begins, eyes narrowing, “do you have?”

He looks around the room, points to the gigantic canvas map the healers working with him yesterday had pinned against the wood paneling for him, “I also want to show you something, okay?”

She doesn't mention how he avoids the question.

Catriona nods, follows his pointed finger to the map and lifts it up when he gestures to it; she returns with several runed practice disks from the built in drawers behind the flag,

“Levitation runes still?” She teases, “Beginner friendly enough—” she traces the curved marks engraved into the wood by his magic, “—but I think you’ve got this mastered, simple or not. You should probably try something else now.”

Dain groans, “What's the last disk in that stack?”

“Delayed activation…” she glances up at him in suspicion, “and I didn’t teach you this. You’ve tempered it quite well, too.”

“Brace yourself, and use it to start the levitation rune.”

Her eyes are sharp brown slits, “Brace myself? Dain, please, you aren’t about to kill us both with some of the most basic runes in existence—”

“Catriona, activate the damn rune.” He cuts, Dain’s voice dips low with irritation and she places the runes ahead of them on the serving table, organizes them at opposite ends of it. Then, she takes a deep breath and places her hand over the activation rune and—

—they _float._

The couch hovers with them on it, ascending slowly. It lifts softly, calmly—alongside the serving table she placed the rune disks on, the intricately dyed rug beneath the sitting area, his desk, the comfy chair behind it. His notes, parchment and documentation of official business. It all glides through the air, never lingering too far from where it had been initially.

Dain takes the levitation rune from where it hangs ahead of him, next to his glass of water that’s now spilt all over the floor and rug. He cycles his magic through until the levitation eventually stops.

The room sits haphazardly undone, as if a gentle storm came through and intentionally set the furniture in odd places about the suite.

Catriona turns to him entirely while gripping the couch.

“Dain Aetos.”

He smiles wryly.

“That—” Her eyes ricochet across the room then back to his face, “At the level you’re at you should be exhausted after doing that.”

“Do you think I could make a rune that protects me from wielding unnecessarily?”

He dishes the question out as she rearranges the suite, pushing the desk back to its place and the chair behind it.

She moves the couch across from the one they were sitting on, “I do, but it won’t be on a wooden disk, and you won’t achieve it overnight.” Cat grunts while moving the couch legs over the perfectly settled rug,

“I’ve been wondering about that—about mediums, how do you even select a medium?”

Catriona leans against the couch with her arms spread wide ahead of her,

“_Typically,_ mediums are chosen based on the _type_ of rune and its required _strength._ You wouldn’t use a wood disk to engrave an active, burning rune. A mage light torch fine, because they don’t actually burn, but if you wanted an immediate flame for cooking, warmth, survival-based… you’d want to use a type of stone or metal.”

“And we use wood for practice disks because they’re easier to set the runes into.”

She’s centering the serving table between the two sofas, and Dain begins to stand so that she can situate the one he sits on, “Tempering magic into metal is much more difficult and dangerous—explosive. A wooden disk explodes and burns up, there’s the initial release of magic through it and most wood won’t hold much that would harm less than a few people.”

“Metal is more destructive?” He brainstorms to her, watching as she hurriedly fixes the couch and gestures for him to sit, then straightens up the map and checks the enclave,

“It’s more destructive because it’s capable of retaining more magic, it’s more expensive, and also in that sense more tedious to produce and attain—think the alloy daggers for killing venin. This is even more apparent if you start considering stones.”

“Are jewels considered the same medium as stones?”

He thinks of the ruby Cath and Dòrainn gifted him.

“Jewels are… extremely dangerous, since they amplify magic as well as retain it with expert tempering. Some of it is superstitious though.”

Dain cocks his head as she continues to explain,

“Obviously there’s the cost and time it would take to cut a piece of… let’s say sapphire—some would consider Dunne and whether or not she’d appreciate you using levitation runes on her precious gems.”

Dain narrows his eyes, “Gods have favored jewels?”

“Don’t they?” Cat suggests with her brows raised, she scratches her cheek and curls up on the opposite end of the couch, then pokes him with her toe, “They have preferred colors, why not jewels?”

“I just thought that jewels were associated by color for cohesion and aesthetic.”

Cat looks baffled and pulls her hair from over her shoulders, “Remember that ruby necklace I got on Zihnal’s Isle?”

He remembers her necklace and also thinks of the slap he received.

He wonders what that was a representation of, then thinks of Trager; maybe it was just Zinhal.

Just _luck._

He leans forward, incrementally as to not pinch his stitches, and answers her, “I do.”

“Well gems have their symbolism and energies, allegedly, and since ruby is associated with both Loial and what she stands for; passion, protection… love—I visited the temple at the northernmost edge of Aretia to make an offering to her.”

His growing empathy for her makes him saddened at the mention of love on her lips, and he’s sure they both think of Trager.

“What’d you offer?” He says softly,

“One of Silaraine’s wing feathers.”

He watches her mouth twitch then move, but without words to follow; their eyes meet and Catriona shrivels before him with a sigh, her eyes fall to the center of the couch,

“You don’t have to talk about it Catriona.” He reaches across the couch and holds her hand, rubs his thumb across her knuckles while raising his shields a level higher than they already are.

The pain she’s feeling is one he hopes to never know, and as he watches her attempt to steady her breath while tears breach the waterline of her eyes. Dain fights an exhausted breath and lifts her chin to face him.

She only smiles as tears roll over her mouth.

“Just make sure you tell everyone Catriona Cordella is a rune master maker—in the making.”

“I will, you're fine to come with me tonight? To head into town?”

She wipes her face off and stands, “Do the siblings know you're sneaking out?”

“Nope.”  
  

---

Sneaking out of Riorson House with Cat is easy enough; in civilian clothing they aren't immediately recognized and they rendezvous with Kiralair in the courtyard.

Catriona's gryphon is beautiful.

Most of the gryphons are, even at a glance. Each gryphon is a walking stormcloud of texture—fur and feathers colliding in ways nature hadn’t intended, but perfected anyway. Kiralair’s coat shifts from pearly white to a smokey silver at her wing and wingtips, the light catches on each layered plume like polished metals.

Their ears are tufted like the large cats he's seen slinking around any expensive palace or manor he's been to; feathered tips flick around to where their attention splits in constant observation. Kiralair turns her head as he approaches, dark honey eyes flashing like polished brass in the torchlight. Her squawk cuts through the courtyard like a bell—sharp, clear, and curious.

Out of habit he bows, though not far thanks to his new injuries, and Kiralair blinks at him before mimicking his stance.

"She says hello... Strange One."

Dain tips up his chin, "Strange One?"

Kiralair only observes him with an icy once-over, then she moves slowly next to Dain. Her body presses against his like a silent question—offering strength without demanding anything in return. He looks to Cat for an explanation.

"She knows you're hurting. She means to provide you support as we travel." Cat informs him while falling to Kira's right; the gryphon expands a wing behind Dain and Cath's thunderous chuckle infects their wasteland,

_"Kiralair is always considerate."_

Cat tells him to put the rucksack on Kira's back and the gryphon squats just enough that he doesn't need to raise his arms to do so.

_"Are you friends with her?"_

Curiosity flickers between the two of them.

_"I am fond of her."_

Dain's brow furrows and Kiralair lifts a taloned foreleg—they begin their trek to Aretia in silence at a manageable pace. Gravel crunches beneath their boots and talons, the night air carries the scent of chilled pine and distant smoke. The town glows ahead, nestled between valleys and mountains, like a bowl of embers—quiet, living, half-forgotten.

As they walk the path, strangers mounted on horses pass them wide-eyed, giving Kiralair—and by extension, Dain and Cat—the sort of berth typically reserved for cursed artifacts or royalty on the verge of snapping. Kiralair ignores them, but her sharp beak tilts upward whenever a carriage clatters by.

Dain leans hard against her side when they hit a steep decline. His boots scrape the gravel like he’s break-bracing for war. His ribs throb. His chest burns. While he attempts not to lose his footing, he wonders if Sloane and Liam grew up in a modest townhome like the ones barely visible along the horizon. He imagines her room was probably a wild color, maybe a bright yellow, or a light blue. Probably something unhinged like coral, or hot pink.

He shoves the thought aside—Sloane was far more mature than she let on for that. He imagines her brushing inches of tamed, blonde hair in an intricate seat, maybe at a vanity in a powder room where young ladies would ready themselves for the occasion. Maybe she slept in silk sleeping sets, the ones he'd seen in a Navarrian storefront with lace intricacies and curved hems.

He’s breathless. Because of the hill.

Definitely the hill.

Not because his whole body is inventing an entirely fictional domestic life and lingerie drawer for a woman who potentially, might still want to kill him.

Even so; he's ninety-nine percent sure she could murder him if she was angry enough and he'd say thank you.

He could spend five days with her. Just five. Five days learning the types of soaps, perfumes and lotions she preferred. What books she liked to read. If she favors coffee or tea, if she likes swimming in lakes versus the ocean, if she would want to cook or eat out.

Is she cat or dog type of person?

Five days of listening to how she says his name while she’s smiling. Or sighing. Or when he’s holding her down—making her take _every fucking inch_ he has to offer. How she'll taste after flying all the way here to see him, or—

Wait—he remembers Melgren gave them a six day Solstice.

_Six_ days of sex? Maybe. Possibly. Absolutely. _Hopefully_.

A white-hot ache splits through his abdomen like lightning. He winces, groaning just loud enough for one of Kiralair’s ears to flick back.

_"Behave."_ Cath grumbles. An emotion trails after it in the bond—something unmistakably parental and deeply annoyed.

Dain thinks about Kiralair's feathers instead.

The wind combs through the longer plumes at her neck, lifting them like silver grass under moonlight. He brushes his fingers along one of the thicker ridges, grounding himself on the warmth of her flank and she runs her beak across the top of his head.

Aretia blooms quietly in the distance—lamplight flickering in half-built windows, laughter echoing between stone walls and scaffolding. Life moves on for the Tyrrish as it does for him, though Dain suspects they all feel caught somewhere between ruin and repair.

Cat glances over at him, brows raised, "What are we doing here anyway?"

"Jeweler," he says, adjusting his grip on the rucksack. "Need an appraisal done."

Catriona clicks her tongue, her eyes are already scanning the storefronts. "Gemstones?"

Dain nods.

They stop at the first place they find—one of only two in town, tucked into a row of converted flats along the market street. The building is squat, stone-faced, and unassuming, with lettering half-faded from rain and time.

Both rider and flier glance at each other with an odd sort of restraint found between amusement and wariness.

"So," Cat starts, folding her arms loosely, "what exactly are we getting priced?"

He can tell she’s trying not to dig too hard—asking without pressing, offering space without retreat. She wants to know, but she won’t pry. Cat's always been the considerate type; she won't do anything involving him unless he invites her in.

He lifts his gaze to her gryphon’s back, then back to Cat. “A ruby.”

She frowns. "...Is that what's in the bag?"

"Yes."

Her head pulls back slightly. She pokes the rucksack with one finger like it might bite.

"It's the size of my _head_."

Dain exhales slowly. "Yeah. It is."  
  

---

The shop is warmer than expected—scented faintly of leather and cedar polish. Its paneled walls are similar to the ones in his quarters back at the suite, all dark grain and gold trimming. It smells like old wealth, something inherited and passed on for generations.

Dain pulls down the hood of his cloak as they step inside. A brass bell above the door lets out a dignified _ding_ as it shuts behind them.

"Mister and Missus!" The voice that greets them is smooth, windworn—it belongs to someone who’s spent years yelling across bustling markets but still wears silk. "Welcome to _Tyrrish Treasures,_ how can I be of assistance today?"

Alright.

Dain squares his shoulders and straightens as far as his stitches allow. He walks like a man used to formal briefings—until the bag shifts on his shoulder and pulls at his side, reminding him he’s held together by stubbornness and bandages.

"Good evening," he says, polite and tight-voiced. "I'm looking to have a stone—" he pauses, correcting— _a jewel,_ appraised."

The shopkeeper, about the same height as he is, smiles wider, "Of course, bring it here, we can get started right away."

Dain and Cat follow the tawny skinned male to a counter near the back of his shop. Catriona eyes the trail of gravel their boots leave across the blue carpet, lips twitching with restrained judgment.

"May I ask what type of gem you've brought us today?"

"Ruby. I was told it was a ruby."

Dain keeps his face as stoic as possible while swinging the rucksack onto the counter. It lands with a thud that makes the wood groan beneath it.

"Ruby," the man repeats, pulling his glasses down the bridge of his nose to peer over the top at Dain like he’s just been personally insulted.

"Ruby."

Dain nods once and loosens the bag’s straps—

—then the man nearly fucking _faints._

Dain reaches instinctively across the counter, splaying his fingers over the sides of the ruby like he's steadying a wounded animal. Beside him, Catriona’s hand drifts toward the dagger at her hip.

"No, I—" the shopkeeper blurts. His face has gone blotchy and wine-dark. He gulps a lungful of air and places his glasses carefully on the countertop, they clatter against his hands and the wood. Then he ducks beneath the counter and reemerges with a heavy monocle, which he clamps over one eye.

He squints at the stone, his expression collapsing into something brittle, doubtful. Whatever he sees—it’s rewriting his understanding of reality.

"My good, _kind_ sir," he says finally, eyes flicking from Catriona to Dain with something between wonder and fear, "my name is Lupe."

_"I am just above,"_ Cath growls.

Dain stiffens. _We’re fine. I shouldn’t have reacted like that._

Lupe presses onward, undeterred. "I have been in the business of gemstones and jewels since I was thirteen. As was my father. And his father. And _his_ father—"

Catriona lowers her hand. Dain’s lets go of the ruby.

"—and this," Lupe declares, breathless, _is no ruby._

He lets out a laugh—sharp and unhinged—that echoes off the glass cases and makes Catriona’s lip curl.

Dain furrows his brow. "I'm certain the person who gave me this couldn’t have been mistaken. Check again."

"No need." He waves off the protest—brusque, final, already halfway down the rabbit hole of gemological disbelief.

"Then I'll take my rock somewhere else." Dain snaps.

Lupe leans over the stone, threading his fingers together with unnerving precision, "This is certainly not just a rock, sir." He shakes his head slowly, in disbelief.

Catriona guffaws beside Dain, "Of course it’s not, that's why we're here.”

_"He is beginning to irritate me."_ Cath barks.

Lupe palms his face, dragging both hands down until his mouth is a flat, grim line of awe. He rips the monocle off and drops it on the counter like it’s suddenly too heavy to hold.

“This is a _red diamond,_” he says hoarsely. “By any chance were you thinking of purchasing Tyrrendor? Perhaps a title just beneath King? Maybe an Isle?”

“There’s no fucking _way,_” Catriona breathes, her expression crumpling between awe and offense.

Dain drags his face toward the ceiling, vision trailing behind him like dust in the wind. He can’t see Cath, but the wasteland that links them groans open—heat rising in spirals from its scorched ground, their battle flag snapping high on its pole as the winds surge in a way that’s not entirely his. Something gathers in the air between them—dense and pulsing, as if the world is holding its breath.

_"Gems like this only come around once a century,"_ he murmurs, more to the emptiness between their minds than to the room itself. _"Maybe even less."_

Cath snorts.  
  
The ground he’s standing on tilts, not literally—but in that other place, in the memory-shaped terrain of their connection, the sands shift and the air thickens. Dain feels the pressure drop, like a storm is about to roll in. His body locks up. Cat’s hand closes around his cloak just as the flag in his mind flails sideways on the pole, and his vision bleeds into something else entirely.

Light filters through stone. Not sunlight—soft and diffused and radiating from the stones themselves, rising from water that glows along the cave floor like moonlight melted and stilled. The air hangs thick with heat and minerals; the walls breathe steam from glistening rock, veined and curved as if carved by patient tides over centuries. Pools shimmer in the center of the chamber, ringed with clusters of gemstones scattered like fruit at the foot of a shrine—some raw and jagged, others smooth as bone, their colors vibrating in the quiet.

Cath speaks—not aloud, not from above, but from everywhere at once, his voice a low, echoing drag across the ribs of the world.

_“There are many. Do you need more?”  
  
_He sways forward. The warmth clings to him still, nausea curling tight in his gut. Cat steadies him, muttering something that doesn’t quite make it through the fog, and he realizes too late that his skin is damp and his hands are shaking.

“I’m fine,” he manages, voice frayed at the edges. “Sorry.”

“Signet?” Her fingers still clutch his cloak, knuckles pale and tense, eyes sharp with something between fear and frustration.

He nods, unsteady. “Yeah. It was just...”

A cave full of stones. A heated pool that glowed like it had swallowed the stars. A dragon older than war, unmoved by the idea of worth.

_“Dòrainn soaks in the hot water,”_ Cath offers, his tone still unreadable. _“It eases his pains. He collects the stones and places them there. I do not know why, nor do I care.”_

Lupe, meanwhile, has shuffled to the door, flipped the sign to _CLOSED,_ and returned with a velvet cloth and an armful of tools—calipers, loupes, tiny brushes, and a stack of books so old they creak when he opens them.

He’s muttering in Tyrrish now, a spiral of half-prayers and gemstone taxonomy. His hands shake as he arranges instruments in surgical precision, eyes wild with the kind of reverence prioritized for divine relics.

“I could simply die,” he whispers. “This cannot be happening. This is a test. I’m being tested.”

_"I told you,"_ Cath says over the wasteland, his voice sudden and loud as thunder, threaded with heat and absolute certainty.

_"I told you, you will never worry for food again."_

Dain stares down at the diamond.

In the past month, he’s learned he’s less than human, been beaten half to death by his father, thrown across a den by an elder dragon, and forced to retrieve a gemstone from between his apex predator’s molars.

And somehow—_this_ is the most surreal part of his week.
