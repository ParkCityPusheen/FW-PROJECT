"Aretia for War Games?!”

It’s the *best* thing she’s heard this whole year—well, close second to *”Then come on my face.*”—and Sloane is more than thrilled about it.

She doesn't fight the girly grin that rips across her face like the rumbling thunder outside, and it pulls her cheeks so tight that they ache. She turns her face away to focus on dressing, hiding an expression that would go unnoticed by Avalynn. She's in that hazy stage—that part of the *day after* that makes her practically levitate the moment she starts thinking about Dain.

The hot water from the shower had rinsed away the slickness of what they’d done, but not the _feeling_ of it—not the sound of his voice when he’d said her name against her shoulder, or the way his arms had lingered around her waist even after sleep.

And definitely not the *stretch* of him, not even fully inside of her. Not his weight, or his girth, or his heat.

Avalynn’s voice cuts through the memory like a whipcrack while picking at her recently dyed locks—blonde now, like Sloane, but more platinum—Sloane bites her lip.

“We’re meant to secure a coded message through the leadership there, while trying to thwart the other Wings from doing so.” She flings her hands up dramatically, 

"Then we return to campus and decode the message with the key that the wingleaders and executive officers will be staying behind to gather. No way we win this. Sloane, I'm so ready to be a second year.”

Sloane grimaces inwardly at the thought of Dain staying behind in Basgiath. She stews on the information.

The hallway is buzzing—cadets charge past with half-buckled gear, the distant roar of dragons circling the courtyard and flight fields already audible through the stone walls of the dorms. 
Stepping from the quiet of Dain’s quarters, to hers, and then into the rush of war prep feels like trading skin.

The transition is abrupt, jarring. 

By the time they reach the courtyard, the sky above them is a shifting canvas of late afternoon clouds fading into a coming storm, and dragons casting brief shadows as they dive and land in quick rotations. Lynx, Baylor, Kai, and—_surprise_—Aaric are already there, excitement mirrored across their faces like children.

“Alright,” Rhi beams, shaking her braids, “feeling better Sloane? Dain said you overdid it during your training.”

She can’t help the fluttering at his name and his preparedness, “Yep—peachy.”

She really can't help how safe and content she felt squished against his body and damnit she tries—*really*—to push away the memory of his broad chest pushed against her back while he slept. Her eyes roll while she fights another cracked smile; what workouts would you have to do to get a tapered waist like that?

How did he exist, almost eclipsed by Xaden when they were both students here?

Dain was gorgeous *with* the personality to match.

Aaric's brow lifts, almost imperceptibly, but enough that she forces the goofy smile far away and quickly. She pays her attention elsewhere; particularly behind them, where dragons have been ceaselessly circling for landing at the flight field with the other wings.

“There’s only the executive officers present for leadership currently,” Kai remarks to Avalynn and herself,

Baylor leans in over all three of them, “Apparently the wingleaders have been whisked away already; I’m guessing they’re over there?”

She follows his bent index finger, the one on his dominant hand that had broken several times already, just this year at that, and sees a red twisting eerily along the bell tower—then another.

"Has to be," Aaric adds, "Only ours has a Red... and that's him, right?"

“Is that…” Sloane gapes, “Why are they doing that?”

“That’s why we’re mustered here.” Lynx grits,

Sloane’s neck jerks at him, “Meaning?”

“Sorrengail, she’s worried about him.” He offers vaguely; he glances at Kai, then back to Cat who looks the most aggravated Sloane had *ever* seen her.

"Yeah, he's been doing that since right after morning muster." Baylor adds,

Her head whips to the front of formation where Violet stands close to Maiselle; they both seem rather dull considering the moment. It’s Violet’s uncharacteristic nail-biting that makes Sloane break formation to squeeze next to her.

“Is something wrong?” She exhales, attempting to feign light disinterest,

Violet only glances at her, eyes narrowed, “Oh—yes."

That was the wrong answer.

Not just dismissive—off. Violet doesn’t play coy. Not like that; something was missing. Something was _wrong_, and if Violet Sorrengail couldn’t—or wouldn’t—name it, how bad did it have to be?

Sloane glances back up at the bell tower, watching Cath and Dòrainn lapse over the other in frenzied speeds. Cath was *far* too calm a dragon to overlook this behavior.

She looks toward Thoirt, expecting something—confirmation, explanation, _anything_—but all she gets is silence, thick and uncomfortable, hanging throughout their bond.

Thoirt always had something to say.

Sloane’s stomach flips.

She points at the two Reds while prodding at Thoirt in their glittering pathway, “You want me to overlook the calmest dragon in our riot acting like *that?*”

“It *is* alarming.” Ridoc deadpans.

Kai steps up next to Sloane, "He said we should expect this, but *that*..."

Thoirt responds first, and it’s—it’s terror, and betrayal, and rage, all pressed savagely into a single statement.

*”We are not able to interfere, Love.”*

Andarna lands ahead of them, her scales black but gleaming that beautiful iridescent where the fading sun humbly gleams upon her scales; she lifts her chin to Violet and her body flickers *red* before shifting back to her resting color.

“I know.” Violet whispers, her voice breaks, “I know.”

Sawyer steps ahead of them, in front of Maiselle, “What’s this Sliseag is saying? That we can’t Interfere?”

“Exactly what you were told.” Imogen points to her Orange before speaking again from behind Sloane,

“These are their orders from the Empyrean—*let it be.*”

Her green eyes cut through Sawyer, he rubs his arm, “I don’t like it,”

“It’s the General.” Maiselle suggests, brows knitted,

“I don’t understand his edge. For what? What does he gain in harassing his son?” Rhi adds.

“Everything’s an edge when you’re a mouth-breathing asshole.” Ridoc grunts while rolling his eyes,

Sawyer scoffs and his freckled face puckers, "That's literally just an asshole."

"Unfortunately," Aaric growls, "There's no one to stand between those two anymore."

There’s a pause, one so uncomfortable that she imagines herself laid across him, waking up in Aretia again, and Sloane’s skin begins to *crawl*.

“Whatever this is it’s much has to be considerably worse what we’re thinking.” Violet says, finally dropping her thumb from her mouth, “Even if I wanted to interject, Tairn is *still* recovering. And now the Empyrean is saying we can't.”

That’s right.

She rode Andarna for the first time anyone had ever seen, leaving Tairn behind and recovering in Tyrrendor, and with an immunity order from King Tauri that left her virtually untouchable within military ranks. Their lightning wielder was missing her lightning—Sloane glances over as Andarna’s scales phase back to black—riding the smallest dragon in the riot, and she wasn’t sure what that left Violet with.

“I’m not participating.”

Their eyes all turn with their heads, collectively landing on Cat,

“I’m not participating seeing the dragon that saved my fucking life fly around like some rabid lesser mammal—that’s clearly *distress.* I’m staying here until I know he’s safe.”

Kai agrees instantaneously, along with the other fliers assigned to Fourth Wing.

“His Squadron is here too, and that Lieutenant Colonel is losing his mind right now.” Bragen adds before Maren steps ahead of both of them,

“Wingleader Aetos’s dedication to protecting and training fliers has made him a priceless ally of King Tecarus and the Poromish, we stay in his stead.”

Overhead of them a Wing takes off, hooting, hollering, *not* worried for their wingleader’s life.

“That’s Third Wing.” Maiselle remarks, “I need the section leaders, now, and you too Sorrengail.”

Sloane watches them retreat to the front of of formation then lets her eyes rake over the rest of the cadets who either do the same, or watch Cath and Dòrainn in the distance.

“Since when does the Empyrean have say in human matters?” Avalynn suggests, twirling her dyed hair around her fingers, “I thought they were too good to be involved deeply with us.”

“Maybe whatever is happening has to do with that other dragon that likes him.” Kai says quietly, “Fliers are all being ordered back to Aretia, they’ll leave with their wings but they aren’t returning—don't repeat that.”

Baylor raises his brows and speaks while eyeing the storm that's headed their way and spreading from the south,

“But *why?* What the fuck is happening?”

Kai shrugs, “Catriona always goes with her gut—and that,” he points at the Reds, “—goes against her gut. Apparently wingleader Aetos hasn’t reported to the professors who are mustering leadership too.”

Something twists inside her. It feels like fear, but more deeply rooted; the feeling brings her back to the sound Cath made as she and Dain scaled the cliffside outside of the Red’s den. Sloane recalls how it made her feel, how it sounded so—

Aaric stalks close behind her, so close his chest brushes against the back of her head, “We aren’t meant to know everything. Let’s trust our seniors and leadership.”

—*unnatural.*

Sloane remembers his confession.

She remembers through the fog of lust that grew thick and sticky between them in his bed, like the syrup he’d licked off his fork after inhaling slices of Tyrrish Toast:

*”Cath and I aren’t normal.”*

And suddenly, suddenly as the storm that whipped through Drathus—that he and Cath launched into to trail after herself and Thoirt, Avalynn’s statement weighs on her heart, *crashes* into her bond with Thoirt:

*“Since when does the Empyrean have say in human matters?”*

The Tyrrish knots Thoirt had tied for her slowly unravel and leave only sparse, shimmering air between the den and Liam’s room, then the bond *pulls* tight when she questions her, and even tighter as Thoirt witnesses the memory of Dain’s confession,

*”This story is not mine to tell.”*

Thoirt admits it beneath a slurry of emotions that are already suffocating her, those concerns for Cath, and it’s already too much when she begins to shield—Sloane chokes out a strangled cry and drops to her knees. 

Aaric is there to catch her, like he always is, hands pried under her armpits and holding her up like a wet cat,

“Sloane?” He gasps, shaking her like it’ll stop the rattling in her chest, she pulls away and barely manages to stand again.

“We can’t leave him.” She’s choking on the words—but they also aren’t hers.

They‘re Thoirt’s, and probably Sliseag, and the other Reds whose riders all twist their necks towards the bell tower when Cath splits the air like a jagged blade through bone—wrong in a way that goes beyond hearing. 

It isn’t a roar. It isn’t even a scream. It’s something else entirely—a warbling, arrhythmic shriek that seems to bend around itself, like it’s echoing from inside her skull rather than the sky above. It rises in pitch, then drops so low she feels it in her teeth as if she were dragging them across the broken edge of a sword, then in her ribs, and finally her spine.

She stumbles.
  
Her knees give out before she realizes she’s falling, and she hits the ground hard, palms scraping against the grass and dirt, lungs locked tight. It’s not just fear—it’s certainty. A cold, foreign solidification to her that Cath did not belong in this world. Not now. Maybe not *ever*.

And then comes the pressure—not from outside, but from within. Her dragon’s grief, sharp and shining, slams into her chest like a second heartbeat. Desperation, wild and white-hot, claws its way through her throat. She can’t breathe. Can’t think. Her dragon wants to reach the other—needs to—and that need becomes hers, too, flooding her nervous system like venom.

But that noise again.

That *noise*.

That noise that might have otherwise been a roar had it not belonged to Cath.

It isn’t wounded. It isn’t calling for help. It’s breaking. Something ancient and enormous is unraveling in front of her, and she feels Thoirt wanting nothing more than to fly to that unmade wailing and hold the pieces together,

Air rushes back into her lungs as she pushes off Aaric again, eyes flared and finger pointing—

“I’m not leaving them.”

—the word are ripped up from her throat ungracefully and Thoirt howls above her, placated but only for half-seconds and heartbeats before Cath cries *again*.

And this time the Reds cry back.

What were they all sensing that she wasn’t? Why did Thoirt’s panic feel _shared_? Was it Cath? No—she wouldn't have felt that. The threads of certainty in her mind snap one by one, until all that’s left is raw instinct.

She makes eye-contact with Violet, who looks over at Rhi and Maiselle; their clock begins to tick again, but this time Sloane is counting the seconds. They’d been talking enough all this time, surely they’d come to a conclusion.

“Fourth Wing will depart, with the exception of Iron Squad.” Maiselle commands, “Rendezvous in Aretia, *with* our wingleader.”

Sloane looks up at Thoirt and her daggertail lands behind her once the crowd of fliers, dragons and their bonds have cleared the courtyard.

She *extends her wing* for Sloane, and not even seconds later they’re nearly close enough to make out the individual scales on Cath and Thoirt manages to calm marginally.

---

Iron Squad remains suspended for over three hours, hovering behind the bell tower, far enough for Dòrainn to not snap at them as he’d been doing whenever anyone flew too close to Cath. Eventually Violet breaks away after speaking with Rhiannon, Ridoc follows, and Imogen and Glaine fly close to herself and Thoirt,

“Alright?” She asks—yells—as the rain and beating wings privatize their conversation.

“Thoirt was panicking.” She admits sullenly, paired with an eye-roll, and hopes that quenches Imogen’s piqued interest in her panicking over Dain-Who-She-Was-Supposed-To-Hate-Aetos,

*”Tell her you remain as panicked as I, little liar.”* Thoirt manages to quip, though it’s missing the witty edge she’d usually carry,

Imogen only nods, “The reds are close.”

Sloane nods.

It’s been raining for fucking hours and her skin was beginning to prune, her flight goggles were filling with water and Violet, alongside Andarna and Ridoc, had now been gone for over an hour. 

She starts to wonder where Violet might’ve gone—begins to form the thought—when Cath breaks away from the bell tower and through the storm clouds above them. Dòrainn attempts to stop him but is helplessly thrown to the side by his den mate, the older Red scrambles midair and screeches at Cath from behind him.

Sloane whips her head up as the flash of bronze cuts through the storm ahead. She doesn’t process what she’s seeing until it’s already happening.

*"Mealladh."* Thoirt hisses,

Cath collides with the Brown scorpiontail—_General Aetos’s dragon_—in a clap of thunder so sharp she flinches. His teeth capture the Brown’s neck as his wings snap against his body, locking into a tight tuck. Gravity takes them both in an instant, dragging them into a vicious plummet.

Mealladh begins to thrash—but it’s too late. Dòrainn joins from below, talons sinking deep into the joints of her wings like meat hooks into soft tendon. The two Reds spiral—not with each other, but around her, wielding her body like a shared weapon. They fall in tandem, wind screaming around them as they twist tighter, faster, like a death spiral born of wrath and fury.

It’s a whirling stoop intended to decimate and her screams are high and terrible. Stone rushes up to meet them and Sloane understands Cath intends to break the earth with her body.

He's past reason.

“What the fuck?” Imogen gasps, hands over her mouth.

What the fuck was *right*, she hadn’t even heard Mealladh above her—she asks Thoirt,

*”She was much too high in altitude,”*

Sloane gapes. Thoirt hadn’t even noticed her there, and Cath was flying in erratic patterns, groaning since he couldn’t roar anymore,

*”He’s not listening to me—Cathachadh can’t feel him. He can no longer sense his bond,”*

*”Thort please tell me he’s not—”*

*”No, his rider persists, though he can't tell from where anymore. Something is worse than before.”*

They slam her into the rocky earth at the base of the tower with bone-crushing finality. Dòrainn doesn’t let go—he wrenches her wings outward, and there’s a snapping sound so loud it cuts through the thunder. 

Cath, still clamped onto her neck, lets go only to rear back and bite again, punishing her spine, her shoulder, her wing base—any piece he can reach through blood and shrieking scale.

Dain not being dead isn’t good enough to quell the anger and the fear simmering in her heart yet again—but then she hears the hollow *snap,* and feels the sickening pleasure, obtains the soothing knowledge from Thoirt that Mealladh wings have both been broken.

Cath roars, properly this time, but to her horror whatever is happening is far from over.

“—Sloane, *move!*”

Imogen’s scream snaps herself and Thoirt out of their bloodlust in enough time for Thoirt to pull sharply backward, just barely making room as a horrendously larger dragon blips past them and straight onto Cath.

“*Codagh?* Is that Codagh?!” Lynx screams. “Sloane, get over here!”

Aaric’s voice rumbles over hers. “Sloane, now!”

*Fuck*—of course Thoirt had to be closest, and of course she was still moving toward Cath, still trying to protect him. She shields, slams her body against Thoirt’s, and presses herself flat in the saddle as she can.

Codagh lands—and his sheer mass knocks Cath sideways.

He turns just slightly—just enough for the pale yellow of his sclera to find Thoirt in the sky, and Sloane’s gut drops.

Cath is pinned. One wing is caught against Mealladh’s crumpled body. The other is bent at an unnatural angle beneath Codagh’s weight as Cath thrashes, snarling and struggling. Dòrainn howls, teeth raking Codagh’s forelegs like he means to tear through stone.. Codagh doesn’t even flinch.

*“Thoirt, please! We shouldn’t be challenging Codagh!”*

Thoirt drowns her in panic. In rage. Sloane's heart lurches with Thoirt's body; Sloane couldn't hear their conversations, if any were even happening, but seeing Codagh standing on Cath made her indescribably fucking angry. However, she was certain going against Codagh was the wrong option in *any* scenario, especially for dragons.

Her daggertail plummets from the sky down towards them, 

*“He will break his wing! He does not deserve it!”*

Codagh reaches down, grabs one of Dòrainn’s remaining horns with his teeth, and yanks him back—steps off of Cath like he’s simply done with him.

Sloane begs Thoirt to wait—*please*, she wills, anchoring her dragon’s trembling wings with the raw threads of their bond—she stills, levels her emotions. 

Cath doesn’t stop for anyone. 

He launches forward with a wounded snarl, tail already lashing midair. 

Rhiannon doesn’t give an order—she moves, like she’s been holding herself back and can’t any longer. Her dragon wheels after Cath, and the rest of their squad follows on instinct, no time to think, only the roaring certainty that something is very, *very* wrong.

Cath hits the administrative building like meteor.

Three floors of reinforced stone collapse beneath him with sickening cracks. His claws carve through walls, stairs, and humans alike—infantry barely managing a scream before they’re crushed beneath him, healers, scribes alike. It's a mix of personnel who were all wandering the building with different objectives.

Sloane's mouth drops like theirs as they scream against the rubble.

He moves like an illness, destroying mercilessly and moral-free, hardwired to *end.* Stone explodes outward in bursts; glass rains down like sleet. His tail cleaves through stairwells, support beams snap like brittle kindling. He claws his way forward—injured, bleeding, but moving fast, too recklessly. Cath’s gutting it all at once until there’s only the general’s quarters left.

His talons drive deep into the ceiling, gripping the structure like it might otherwise fly out from under him. With a snarl that vibrates through Sloane’s sternum, he peels the roof back—not in frustration, but with a horrifying calm, like removing the lid of a boiling pot. He flings it forward, the slab crashes to the courtyard below, and then—he goes still, neck coiled low. Shoulders heaving.
  
And Sloane sees it through his eyes better than she sees it for herself from where she's seated; Cath *shows* Thoirt, and she shares the sight with Sloane.

*Dain.*

Folded into a chair like a discarded rag doll, his body slumped unnaturally forward, held in place by more than just gravity. Thick metal cuffs connected to the floor bite into his wrists breaking the skin well through flesh; they keep his hands bolted so far apart that his arms are wrenched at impossible angles with his palms forced flat against the floor. His arms are broken, at the shoulders, at the elbows, at his wrists.

A chain is cinched so tightly to the chair he's forced to lean out of, that his whole frame is strained and unmoving between neck, seat, and floor—stretched like some grotesque display.

Blood mats his hair and clings to the back of the chair in rust-red streaks. His shirt hangs in ribbons, barely concealing the lattice of stab wounds that mar his chest and abdomen—deep ones, deliberate and cruel. They bleed sluggishly, the flow slowed not by mercy but by exhaustion; Thoirt can tell his heart is slowing by the second. 

Beside Dain's body lies a halberd, once ceremonial, now ruined—its ornate shaft spattered in gore, the gleaming spear-tip snapped off and left buried somewhere inside him or shattered in the violence. The contrast is obscene: something beautiful and sacred, repurposed for torture.

His eyes are swollen nearly shut, lashes crusted with dried blood, lips split at the corners. 

And his breathing—

It’s wrong. It *sounds* wrong. Each rise and fall of his chest is accompanied by a faint, wet popping. One of his lungs must be collapsed, and every breath is a quiet scream trying to survive the damage.

Somehow, Dain moves.

Barely. Trembling so violently his bones seem like they might give, he lifts his head and presses it—his forehead—to the center of Cath’s snout and his head looks like a sizable crumb on his dragon’s lip.

He shakes, then his mouth drops open and he *sobs.*

“Cath—,” he wheezes, “Cath, I’m so glad you’re okay.”

Cath inhales his own deep, nearly prompts the disconnection of his shared vision. For a moment, it feels like her own lungs are compressing—like his grief has taken on mass, weight, and temperature. 

Dain’s turning blue against the rain, he's wasted too much breath speaking.

Sloane feels Thoirt's relived pain as Iron Squad's dragons share the sight with their riders as well.

The vision clings to them like oil—Sloane, Rhiannon, Sawyer, Imogen, her years-mates, Cat and Maren, Bragen, all of them trapped in the unbearable intimacy of the moment, forced to see how violently Cath seems to want to lift his rider out of the wreckage and undo every injury on his flesh.

Cat screams—*"Get him out of there!*" and she presses forward with her gryphon, eyes wide, and soaked from the rain.

Cath lifts his head and turns after Cat drops from Kira into the rubble. Slowly. Intentionally and silently. He unwinds his great crimson body from around the General's Quarters and his jowls drop open.

His eyes find Codagh across the split in the ruins; there’s no roar. No warning. *Nothing.*

Just the screeching wind and rain sluicing across his bloody body as he attacks.
