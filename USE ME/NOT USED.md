Cath had teased Dain about Sloane not having told him her favorite color; if she asked him what *his* was it'd be easy to answer.

*Deep Marigold.*

He wasn't sure if that was an actual color. He tilts his head while staring at Cath; the Navarrian Scientific Standardization Organization were the ones who officially adopted more nuanced colors into existence within the common tongue.

Would the color just after his dragon's pupils exist officially?

*"You have shielded for two days straight, Knight. Impressive, however unpleased I am with this little rebellion of yours."*

Dain kicks a rock and it bounces off Cath's talon,

*"It's not a rebellion, it's a boundary—learn the difference."* He lifts his head and is swallowed whole by the Red's peeved glare.

There have been many times Dain’s called Cath’s stare the most terrifying thing he’s ever experienced and somehow, over time, he’s gotten used to it. When he was younger Cath didn't show himself often, but there were times he would spot the swordtail watching him between trees and across lakes, even in the ridges of mountains and when their eyes met, his stomach would plummet clean through his boots. There was no point in hiding anything—Cath didn’t just see him, he _sensed_ him. His shame and fear, even curiosity.

Dain had learned young that secrets didn’t survive under that stare, and they were eventually ripped right out of him.

Cath's stare, glance, his focus given entirely to anything was also deeply *disturbing.* All dragons had eyes set faced forward in their skulls which meant if a dragon were staring in a person's direction, they were looking *right at you.* From miles away he'd watch, silently encroaching in Dain's space for the right time to let himself be revealed through scopaesthesia—or that crawling, heat-slick certainty you’re being watched by something that doesn’t blink.

He would hold the eye contact once it'd been made; unphased at his being discovered. It wasn't until threshing that Dain noticed the braiding of that deep marigold he was now so fond of; it twisted and turned and glowed against the glittering gold of the rest of his eyes, expanding and contracting as the intensity of his held gaze practically burned Dain alive.

*"I exist in your heart in mind, do I not?"* Cath grumbles, lifting his chin in indignation.

*"Sure. You live there. Doesn’t mean you get to narrate everything I think. Don't you understand that expecting privacy and giving me none is conceptually unfair and unusual."*

Cath's head lowers to his height as much as he can get it to, *"There is nothing 'conceptually' normal about our relationship."*

"*I understand that,*" the breath he swallows lifts his shoulders and swells in his lungs, *"but I still want some privacy."*

*"I cannot grant you that. But I understand your frustrations."*

*"Do you?"*

Cath's eyes narrow into slivers, his dragon huffs an impatient breeze that makes Dain squint, *"I do."*

*"Can you tell me why I can't have you outside of my head for more than five minutes without you devastating me mentally?"*

*"If the part of you that intends to abuse the source from which you channel, I must know."*

Well—he's not wrong to worry about that, Dain glances down at his hand and feels near the corners of his eyes, in fact both of them were worried about the *venin* parts of him that had yet to surface. He snorts thinking about what he's going to say and Cath's wings bump fractionally; forget the venin talk: how could he talk to Sloane properly about his feeling when he couldn't even get them across to his damn dragon?

*"I still want privacy. It takes less than nothing for me to drop my shields."*

Cath's body shoots upwards and some passing riders jump out of their skin at the sudden movement, *"Not convincing. They were not dropped until the most dire moments before the Wretched One took you from me."*

His pupils slide to the bottom of his eye sockets.

*"I don't know what my father's signet is. I was scared he might hurt you through me, then..."* he kicks another rock and it ricochets off Cath's talons again, *"I dropped them when I gave into fear entirely, but I shouldn't have."*

*"Why must you fear another human when I am here, or that humans can hurt me?"* his swordtail snorts, *"Worry less of me and more of your Favored."*

*"Why do you bring her up every chance you get? You never did this when it was Violet."*

Cath snorts again, but this time his jaw drops open just enough to show all his ivory teeth, *"Because she never once felt the same."*

Dain pulls his head back in disgust. What the hell does Cath know about Violet feeling anything—about any human besides himself feeling any type of way?

*"Your ego can't give you abilities you don't have."* his voice drips with sarcasm that makes Cath's eyes narrow again,

*"No special gift required to read body language and atmosphere, you dense rock."*

His jaw drops in shock, *"I am not dense."*

*"I am not a dragon."*

Cath’s wings flare, casting the whole courtyard in shade.

*"Courting is done by all species, and failed only by you."* he chuffs, 

Dain crosses his arms. _"You haven’t successfully courted anyone either. Unless you count terrorizing people from hilltops as foreplay."_

The scales between Cath's eyes press together, *"You are overdue for divine intervention."*

*“And you’re overdue for a mate who appreciates how emotionally unavailable you are.”*

*"They’d only need to be half as difficult. You are proving to be a lifelong test of patience."*

*“That’s rich coming from the dragon who throws temper tantrums from not being in my head for five seconds.”*

*"If I stayed out, you'd unravel faster than your shieldwork. Forgive me for preventing disaster."*

Dain taps his forehead, *"Actually, it's been two days."*

Cath leans down again, so close and quick Dain nearly steps back,

*"And it **won't** happen again."*

Sloane’s glaive is forged by Daux, tempered in turns by Trissa, Kiandra, and Cat—each rune laying a piece of themselves into the weapon’s bones. But it’s Dain who makes it hers. He spends hours tying cord around the base of the blade: thick as his pinky, the silk is a dyed *marigold*, threaded through Tyrrish knots that each serve meaning beyond form. Beneath them, a second length of rope—rougher, braided simply—binds the haft in a layered pattern so the decorative cord sits raised, almost ceremonial.

_"What do they mean?"_ Cath asks, voice drowsy with disinterest.

_"Adapt, overcome, and survive,"_ Dain mutters. His eyes narrow. _"In theory."_

He thinks it’s beautiful—and vicious. The blade’s edge is the length and width of his arm, forged in a dark, smoky metal that shimmers oil-slick beneath any light, no matter how greasy the fingers that handle it. The head curves back like a predator’s grin, splitting halfway down into a thick catch-hooked, secondary blade that’s entirely unnecessary and cruel in both shape and implication. Dain wonders, vaguely, if she’ll ever struggle to whet it properly where the blades meet.

The lower blade tapers more narrowly, fanged at its outer edge and sharpened just beneath a matching decorative metal collar. Gold trims flicker faintly at the crosspoints of construction—not garish, just enough to suggest artistry beneath the edge.

Now that his part is finished, he lays the glaive across his knees, fingers brushing the cord's tasseled ends. He balances it, testing the center of gravity and the weight while distributed at odd points of contact,

_"Should I cut the pieces of cord that hang?"_

_"No."_

*Why?"*

*"I think she'll like it."*

Dain rolls his eyes and Radomirka lifts a ink black brow, *"Based on what?"*

*"On what her dragon's told me about her."*

Dain squints at Cath, instantly suspicious. If Thoirt and Cath were talking, were they talking about _him_ and Sloane? To _each other_? It’s not like he could ask her—Thoirt—and she probably didn’t want to talk to Dain anyhow. And of course Cath would say it like that, smug as ever, like Thoirt had taken one look at his rider and decided _pass_. Never mind the fact that she literally couldn’t speak to anyone she wasn’t bonded to.

_"She doesn’t,"_ Cath murmurs, still smug.

Dain scowls. _"I just said that."_

"Got your hair cut again?"

Brennan’s cleared him to spar, and the first person to find him is none other than Ulices Ferris. He wastes no time—makes Dain run laps around the officers’ sparring chamber until his chest is burning.

"Yeah," Dain huffs, dragging his hair out of his face. "Not used to it being so long."

Ferris guffaws. "It’s _still_ long."

"I know."

"Then why not cut it close, like before?" the older man suggests, stretching.

"Because someone told me it looks better longer."

Ferris’s grin spreads wide. He steps in, raising his shortsword. "Oh? Which one is _she_?"

Dain laughs. "Who said it’s a she?"

He reaches for the sword’s hilt, but Ferris doesn’t let go. Instead, he pulls it to his chest — Dain’s hand caught between them.

"Because I wouldn’t give two shits or a damn if it wasn’t the woman I fancied saying it."

"You’d be surprised who has opinions on what," Dain fires back, grinning just as hard. "Don’t you have some important General things to be doing?"

Ferris releases the sword and steps back. "Making sure Aretia’s only flightleader is in top form to represent the revolution? What could possibly be more important?"

Dain looks away for a beat.

He’s always been able to tell when someone was lying. Since childhood it came to him instantly, like scent or sound. And something about the way Ferris says it—about how casually he drops _revolution_ and _top form_ in the same breath, sticks.

Dain watches the old man watch _him_, expression unreadable as he lifts his axe.

"If I sustain this training today, you tell me what you're lying about."

Ferris's facade doesn't slip, but his answer gives away his farce,

"You back out you tell me who it is."

It's playful, inviting even, the way he dismisses Dain's suspicion.

It’s the type of dismissal meant to sand down suspicion rather than confront it. Dain knows it for what it is, but still he grins again, already imagining the look he’d have gotten if he told Ferris the one with opinions about his hair isn’t a woman.

It’s his _dragon_.

"If you were to plan a five day elopement, how would you do it?"

Catriona's eyes widen and press into suspicious line while she, Maren, and Kai spill into the suite; he'd been sitting at his desk with Sloane's glaive resting across it, curing the ropes and knots he'd intricately tied with a wick and flint stone,

"Do you want me to pretend that I'm stupid or blind, and not notice the Riorson-Sorrengail part two happening right before my fucking eyes right now?"

*"This one is so perceptive. But then again what you fail to read in a room others read in you."*

"What do you mean?"

He covers his mouth
