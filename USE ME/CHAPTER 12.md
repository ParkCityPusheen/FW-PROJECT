### [Chapter 12](https://archiveofourown.org/works/63478354/chapters/167630101): Dain | Prayer

She's concussed and has severe tracheal damage.

It takes him five minutes to find Brennan and ten to get him to the goddsdamned infirmary to mend her.

Dain wonders if shock stopped her from feeling the full extent of her injuries when Brennan pulls away once he’s finished working on her, 

"This was planned?" he seethes, "How do you even know that?"

"Maiselle has a signet that lets her disguise herself as another person for a period of time," Dain begins, fiddling with the flat sheet of Sloane's cot, "she told me a few days ago she overheard the First Wing wingleader plotting a while back."

"Do you—,"

Dain cuts him off, "I have it handled. No one touches any marked ones on my watch or _especially_ in my Wing. Riorson just figuratively died protecting all of us and this is the fucking thanks he gets."

Brennan's head tilts, "Are you sure?"

"I have to be able to handle things on my own." Dain presses, sitting up.

He was a cadet with a whole unit on his shoulders. If he couldn't defend his peers then how could he lead in a battle? He snarled inwardly; failure was not an option, and assistance wasn't needed.

"Can you do whatever it is you have planned without over exerting yourself?"

"I've got solid plan and trustworthy bodies."

Brennan's eyes run up the length of Sloane and settle at her throat, "I think you two should break from class tomorrow."

Dain gives Brennan a quizzical look.

"She could've wielded, sucked the life out of the bastard." His jaw tightens, "She should've."

Yes. She should've.

"You need to break her out of this mindset. Whatever way you can think of."

Dain pauses, cautiously asking, "Did Naolin go through a phase where he didn't want to wield?"

"No." Brennan looks away, "No classes tomorrow, I'll make sure you're both excused." 

"Can't you help with her training? You know the only other siphon—,"

Brennan's eyes darken and he tucks his chin, "Dain, I can't train someone who doesn't want to use their signet." he shifts his weight,

"She does wield, and she's good at it, she just—!"

"Stop babying her. Xaden told me you tried doing the same thing with Violet; it's not helpful. You're enabling her—,"

Dain shoots up from his chair, "I'm not _enabling_ shit; Sloane has a signet that shows up as often as Violet's does, and paired with the emergence of venin she's rightly terrified to wield it. And I loved Violet, I was _in love_ with Violet, I was afraid for her, I was afraid to lose her so don't fucking..."

He thinks about who he was when she crossed the Parapet. The sleepless nights fretting over her life, watching her get injured over and over; the feeling when she finally began pushing him away. He didn't know better at the time. But he understood entirely what it meant to lose someone; to watch them breathe their last, the _rattle_ of their body as they passed over to Malek, still warm to the touch.

"Don't take my fucking feelings and good intentions and weaponize them against me. I never meant to hurt anyone. I only ever tried to protect them. Don't you fucking make me out to be a villain,"

Brennan's eyes are wide, "Calm down—,"

"Don't tell me to fucking calm down Brennan," he snarls.

They stare at each other and the seconds pass thickly, like the blood dried on Dain's face and like the bruises now gone from Sloane's throat.

"No class tomorrow." he grunts, "Come check in with me tomorrow night."

He leaves without another word, ripping back Sloane's curtain and absconding into the brightly lit hallway of the infirmary. Dain stays standing in front of his chair, his anger is palpable and he glances over at Sloane who's eyes are shut, her chest rises and falls rhythmically. He counts her breaths, squeezing his eyes shut as he realizes it's the _second_ time he's pathetically cried today; just like when he gave Sloane mouth-to-mouth on the sparring mat. His tremors are rough and his breathing is forced. His cries are sharp and silent, and he grips his fists tight, digging his nails into his palms.

Why is he so hard to fucking understand?

He pinches the bridge of his nose and breathes in deeply, still shaking, "Cath..."

_"I am here."_

_"Please just talk to me."_

_"Thoirt is upset with your Favored."_ he grumbles,

_"Why? She almost died."_

_"...she made no attempt to save herself."_

He feels the telltale signs of Cath's attempt at soothing him; friendliness and comfort heat in the cracked earth of their bond, and the feeling explodes in his chest. It's warmth, and love, and loyalty; Cath personified in a feeling. Dain manages a sigh and wipes his face as he sinks back into his chair.

_"She was probably confused and scared. She didn't come from a home that honed her the way her brother was."_ he challenges,

_"Her anger is with herself,"_ he sighs, speaking of Thoirt, _"dragons may not always pass when their riders do, but to be possibly harmed because of your bond's slight is unacceptable."_

Dain grit his teeth.

He was right.

It wasn't just Sloane at risk by refusing to wield, it was Thoirt too. Thoirt and herself were liabilities to each other if this continued.

"Are you okay?"

He jerks his neck up at the sound of Sloane's voice; it chimes through his train of thought, ripping him away from his subconsciousness like a storm.

"You're awake," he chirps, "How are you feeling?"

He smiles at her and she grimaces.

"You're crying again." she rasps, then while frowning, "I feel fine."

"I know. It's probably gross." his smile shrinks and he feels his cheeks relax as it fades into something shy, "I'm sorry."

"You're sorry?" she blinks, sitting up and wrapping a hand around her throat,

He clears his and nods.

"I heard you guys talking." She says so softly he has to lean forward against the bed to hear her properly,

"...How much of it."

"I woke up when you yelled at him, about Violet."

Their eyes meet at the same time. His bronze and her sapphire, dehydrated clay and a still lake, both tired.

"Do you feel like I'm... setting you up for failure?" he mutters,

She shuffles against the cot and begins to undo her braids.

"You've never once made me feel like that." she tells him, and when her hair is loose from its restraints she leans towards him too, placing a clammy palm against his cheek, "Don't cry, okay?"

Her voice is uncertain, as is her touch, but he's quick to lean into it, practically _nuzzling_ her, "All right." he murmurs against her palm,

"I had a lapse in judgement." she proclaims, exhaling deeply, "On two important things."

"What were they?"

She sighs and pulls her hand away, Dain groans softly, following her palm a few inches before settling back into his chair. Sloane pushes herself far away from him to the edge of the cot,

"Would you...?" she whispers, sheepishly pulling the sheet back to expose space enough for him to sit next to her.

He looks around, searching for the _no disturbances_ sign to hang on the outside of her room, then returns and sheds his flight jackets and uniform top. He folds them over the back of his chair and pulls her curtain shut.

"You sure you want me there?" he fidgets at the foot of the mattress, watching her with wide eyes,

"Only you." she answers.

A shiver explodes through him and his heart misses a beat as he kicks his boots off and climbs in next to her.

"They were me," she has to crane her head up to meet his eyes now, "and _you_."

His nod is slow, sincere, "You—,"

"Listen to me," she sputters, her hand brushes against his between them as they lay upright against the headboard,

"Just listen to me."

"Okay."

Sloane is quiet as she organizes the words in her mind; she speaks slowly when she's ready.

“When you love someone, you’re loyal to them. No matter the circumstances. No matter the variables. It’s a commitment.” Her voice hitches. “I’ve done the math, the rehashing, the conversating. And it’s hard for me to believe that opening myself up to you isn’t, somehow, betraying Liam. Because in the end… he was collateral in a game your father played. And you—well you're his son.”

She tucks her hair behind her ears and it makes his fingers itch to do the same.

"You said to Brennan yourself: you've only ever tried to protect us." she breaks on her inhale, sniffing roughly as her own tears begin to form against her lower lashes, "People complain about you, and it's for being too thorough. Too stiff."

She licks her lower lip and saws it between her teeth, peeking up at him through her lashes, "Not because you have ill-intentions. In fact, I've never heard of you doing anything to intentionally hurt anyone. And it's on that basis that I can consider why I get jealous when I see you with Cat. Or why I want all of your attention in front of anyone else. Why I feel so special about the amount of time you spend on me, especially when you really don't have any to spare."

Sloane sheepishly grabs his thumb, squeezing it. “Do you think I’m betraying him?”

His heart flutters—too fast, too loud—and he nearly chokes on it trying to respond.

“No. No, I don’t think anyone has the right to dissect your intentions—let alone call them traitorous.” He works her hand into his palm, "And thank you.... for _seeing_ me."

Sloane's laugh is muted; nothing like her boisterous existence, "I mean, you've seen me and look at how I've treated you."

He softens, sincere. “It’s okay. You have every right to feel the way you do.”

"Can you, please, forgive me?"

"You don't need my forgiveness,"

"But I _want_ it." she whines,

"Fine. Okay. Yes, I do." he runs his thumb across the back of her hand and she threads her fingers between his, "Cath told me Thoirt was upset with you, maybe tomorrow we can go see them, so you guys can talk."

Her hand slides away from his so she can wipe away her tears again, "I figured, she hasn't spoken to me since I came to."

"If Cath and I can get passed some things I'm sure the two of you will be fine."

He and Cath had some past conflicts that were horrifying, especially in his first year. Dain feels childish thinking back to them,

_"Hatchling."_ Cath prods, playfully.

A small breath of laughter escapes his nose and he looks down at Sloane who begins to burrow into the cot,

"Will you stay with me tonight?" She yawns,

Dain wrinkles his nose, "I'm covered in blood."

"Okay, well, will you come back?" she presses, her head turns up to look at him,

"We can," he licks his bottom lip, "both go shower, and meet back at my room. If you want."

Sloane takes only a moment to respond.

---

He wakes up in the late morning, sore, but feeling fresh with Sloane pendulous against his torso and side.

The sun sinks into his room through the window between his and Troy's beds and for a few minutes it warms them as its rays splinter across the bed at an angle. Sloane is tuckered out, her face plastered against the skin of his chest at an upwards angle because she fell asleep talking to him. Her mouth hangs open enough that her front teeth peak out just beneath her full upper lip. He fights the urge to press his thumb against her pout; she probably wouldn't appreciate his fingers on her mouth. Her sweet scent is intoxicating and the skin-ship between the two of them makes him weak.

He wants to die right here, just like this. _This_ is more than enough for him and far more than he deserves.

He traps his left forearm behind his head and drapes his other across her waist, squeezing her hip, digging his fingers against the sharp bone there. She frowns and shuffles away from his hand, pressing herself closer to him. She fits against his body like a sword in it's sheathe, unquestionably made to fit and _perfectly_.

He wonders, if he stabbed himself right now, would he bleed—and which god should receive the prayer for such a coveted revelation?

Gods, he's fucking _hard_.

He can see it through the sheet, curved against his thigh.

Dain removes his hand from Sloane and rubs it down his face.

"You're up."

He freezes.

"Good morning," he croaks, his voice is heavy with sleep,

"Oh," she says, peaking up at him, "You're up _too_."

Sloane's hair falls to one side and over her shoulder as she raises up against his chest, looking down at him while the sun eclipsed against her face and and waves.

She was like a stained glass portraiture; every curve and line were deliberate, her colors were bold and complimentary, he flexed his hands to stop himself from slamming her mouth against his—she was art meant just for viewing. Sloane squinted down at him in the sunlight, gold eyelashes scattering shade across her cheeks and her bright blue eyes capturing any bit of attention he could give.

He wouldn't touch her if she didn't ask for it.

Looking was more than enough.

"Inappropriate." he drowsed,

"So..." she yawns into her hand, then folds them both over his right pec, "can we talk about," she points to him and then herself, "maybe just one more time before you start getting into the gritty stuff."

"We can," he answers, dropping his hand back across her waist and twirling the golden waves that run across her back against his fingers, "We can talk about moving forward with your training and what happened with Kavanagh when we get back from Thoirt and Cath."

"Okay..." she grimaces and her eyes dull a bit,

"Right, so go ahead Mairi." he quickly blurbs, hoping to reignite her, "Speak your truths."

"I think I'm interested in you. _Romantically_." her face takes on a pinkish hue that swipes across her nose and cheeks,

"I am too." he blurts, sitting up a bit,

"Yes, I've known." she rolls her eyes and pushes him back down, 

"Didn't you feel embarrassed talking like that all those times?"

Dain feels his laughter erupt deep in his chest before it leaves his mouth, and his body vibrates as tumbles out of him, "If only you'd been there my second year to witness the shitshow I preformed for the quadrant."

"With Violet? Was it that bad."

"I cannot compete with Xaden Riorson." he declared, scratching his head, "He's just better than me."

Sloane dropped her chin against her hands on his chest, and he bent his neck downwards to keep his eyes on hers,

"No. Xaden acts like Sgaeyl pisses in his porridge every fucking morning. Being secretive, angry, and violent is an exhausting trope."

"I thought you liked him." Dain mutters incredulously, his eyes are glued to her nose; the way it crinkles when she recalls something she dislikes has always made him smile inwardly,

"I do." Sloane groans, "I love him, I really do, but that doesn't change the fact the he's a raging dickhead."

"You call me a dickhead too."

"Different breed of dickhead?" She shrugs,

He laughs again, "I'd gotten over the shyness pretty quickly. I figured if you gave me a chance I'd be an officer pursuing you, and the whole wingleader, ex-Violet thing would die in the dirt." he waved the hand at her hip, "I'd just be a random guy again."

"Well you're popular with the first years right now." She says, blushing again, "You're all... _nonchalant_, participating in fight clubs, training veteran fliers and riders, and not y-know—," she sits up and pretends to push a pair of glasses up the bridge of her nose, while holding an invisible book, and belts in a nasally tilt: _"According to Article fifteen, Section five point three of the Codex..."_

He covers his mouth to laugh this time, squeezing his eyes shut.

"It was you." she raises the shoulder her hair tumbles over, touching it to her ear.

"Did you like that version of me too?" he wonders aloud, sitting up and causing her to slide down his torso,

She looks away before answering, staring out the window to the valley, "I guess I did."

He grins.

Sloane follows suit when he exits the bed to change into his leathers, watching him change the same way he watches her. The blush on both of them is unforgivable.

"Gonna go brush my teeth, I'll meet you in the mess hall." he glances out the window, "I think it's not too late for staff and watch breakfast."

"Wait." Sloane chirps,

She's in her unform but her hair isn't braided yet and falls past her shoulders like a thick silk cloak, her eyes are serious, and the twinkle behind those pastel coronas are wild like the night sky,

"What is this... that we're doing."

Dain smiles.

_That's easy._

"Establishing a friendship." he crosses his room to where she stands by the shared armoire,   
"Establishing a friendship, but I have every intention of making you mine for the rest of my life—if you'll have me." 

---

Breakfast is a treat in light of the cruelty that unfolded yesterday.

Dain's plate boats Tyrrish Toast, a Yuzu (basically what would be considered an orange in Navarre, but with a lemony aftertaste), four boiled eggs, a few fat tomato slices and corned beef hash where any leftover space had been.

"Do you always eat this much?" Sloane points at his plate with her fork, mouth agape,

"Yes." he takes a heavy swallow of coffee, his brain settles at the aromatic hints of the Tyrrish brew, "I'm always hungry."

Her head jerks back in surprise, "Always?"

Sloane's plate has a yuzu, one boiled egg, and two pieces of the sugary Tyrrish Toast. Her hair is plaited into a singular braid that splits into two at the base of her head, he admires the intricacy of it as he takes another swallow—he'd make a proper effort to watch her do her hair whenever he got the chance.

"Always."

"That's odd," she muses, "considering you skip like every meal."

"I need to stop doing that." he grunts,

_"Yes."_ Cath growls.

_"I need to figure out my banking."_ he reminds the Red; he couldn't eat properly in Aretia since his father liquidated his account from the parent one. Aretia docked meals from their pay and he was officially _broke_.

_"Well do it soon or I'll leave sheep and cattle in the courtyard for you to eat."_

Dain groans, _"All right Cath."_

"Cath?" Sloane guesses,

Dain begins peeling the yuzu, "Scolding me for skipping meals,"

"Good, you shouldn't." She purrs,

His brows float off his forehead, "And _you_ should wield your signet."

Sloane glares at him.

"We're taking a hike right after this, Cath won't let Thoirt leave the den so we're going to them instead."

"We're going _in_ a dragon den." Sloane's jaw breaks over her plate, _"Into the den?"_

"It's Cath's so we'll be fine, just make sure if you speak out loud that it's respectful." he commands through a mouth of hashed beef, "The other's might not even be there."

"You've been in the den before?"

"Not this one, but a few times back in Navarre, and once in—,"

Cath beats the fabric of their battleflag, a _warning_. Sloane didn't know he'd been bonded since long before Basgiath. The few times he'd been in the dens were because he'd nearly burnt out or had some sort of emotional breakdown, and Cath would deposit him there, sleep circled around him, then kick him out in the morning.

"No eye contact, and stick close to me or your dragon."

Sloane nods, "Why isn't he letting her leave the den?"

Dain pauses.

_"Tell the fool."_ Cath snarls.

"... he's just worried about Thoirt."

_"That is not what I said."_ Cath barks.

Dain tunes him out, "Ready to go?"

Sloane breathes deeply and looks at the toast still on her plate, "Yep."

---

Cath's den is an unnaturally erected cave.

Unnaturally because he plundered the mountain side until it was big enough to fit him, and then other's of his kind find him and make the space big enough for two, and then another joins, and so-on. Eventually there's a network of tunnels attached to different openings for them to come and go.

He's not surprised that he's chosen the cliffs directly beneath Riorson House; he's always got to be a sneeze away from Dain—_just in case,_ he says.

When they arrive Sloane walks so close to him that their arms rub unceremoniously against each other and had she been anyone else he'd of told the to back the fuck off; but he finds himself wishing she'd hold his hand. Her forehead bears a slight coating of sweat and her mouth is parted. The hike to the den ended up including a climb once the reached the lowest walkable part of the cliffs.

"I didn't think I'd be doing life-or-death rock climbing."

"You got through the Gauntlet just fine." Dain reminds her as they enter the first communal area,

"This is fucking _huge_." she gasps, "I mean how many dragons live here for an opening this big to be needed?"

Dain shakes his head, he's not sure himself. The clearing feels like its easily six times the size of the rotunda back at Basgiath,

"Wait," Sloane grabs his uniform sleeve, "If this is Cath's den doesn't that make him the head of his den?"

_"No."_ Cath sighs.

"This is just his erected den, he's not the head of the Reds. He might be an old man, but I don't think he's _that_ old."

_"Watch yourself, Knight."_

Dain laughs loudly.

"I feel like they all live here though," Sloane whispers when a rustling of gravel happens down a tunnel to their right, "I mean honestly look at the size of this place. _And_ this is right under Riorson House; I can't believe we didn't feel them make this."

_"Straight back."_

As they clear the first opening into a tunnel directly ahead of the entrance, Dain hears Cath's clicking warble, "This way."

"That was Cath." Sloane announces, falling instep behind him,

"Sure was. You recognize what he sounds like?" Dain asks her, he looks down at her over his shoulder, "What's it like to you?"

Sloane looks up at him, "Strange. I'd be able to pick him out in a room full of dragons based on what he sounds like."

Ahead of them Cath lays comfortable against the wall of the cave they've entered, next to him Thoirt stands, her tail flicking impatiently, and to his left another red peers at them. When he glances to Cath's far right there are two more and Dain drops his head out of habit,

_"You will show fealty."_ Cath grumbles through the bond.

Dain lifts his head and slams his forearm against his chest, "Dain Aetos." he loudly introduces himself, "Cathachadh's bonded—I apologize for the intrusion."

_"She will speak with Thoirt, you come to me."_

He feels Sloane tug at his sleeve, and he glances down at her, "Go to Thoirt, I'll be with Cath." he smiles and takes his place directly under Cath's head, which he lays across his outstretched forelegs, hiding Dain in a tangle of limbs. He's happy to avoid from the piercing stares of the three other dragons, but he worries for Sloane, who's head hangs heavy between her shoulders.

_"I am happy for you."_ Cath says gently, he taps his tail against the roughed cave floor,

Dain feels the heat of his blush creep up his neck and ears, _"Thanks."_

_"I believe the two of you will be good for the other."_ He continues, _"Thoirt has been my balance for many decades."_

_"Really?"_ Dain peaks at Sloane and Thoirt past Cath's scales, 

Cath chuffs, _"Really."_

Sloane's body language morphs overtime; her back straightens, her shoulder's square, and she lifts her head to meet Thoirt's gaze. Her Red cranes her neck down so that she's within reachable distance to Sloane, and the blonde laughs loudly.

She looks directly at Dain from where she stands in the center of the cave and grins.

"We have a lot of work to do." she says cheerfully, her eyes wet with tears once again,

He smiles back at her, and Cath lifts his head to speak to Thoirt.

"All right." Dain nods, grinning back at her, "I've got you."
