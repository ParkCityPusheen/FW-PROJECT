### [Chapter 4](https://archiveofourown.org/works/63478354/chapters/165355090): Dain | Distraction

“Do you normally try to out people in public?” Sloane spits at him as she falls into the seat next to his left; he managed to avoid her until Battle Brief.

Dain doesn’t spare her a glance, “What do you mean?” He bites back, “Asking why you’re frequenting my personal space is a crime?”

“In front of everyone?” She glares, leaning up above his lap to make forced eye contact with him, “Yes!”

“If I can’t talk to you about it in public we shouldn’t be doing it.”

She shakes slightly, fisting her leathers, “We aren’t doing anything!”

“Then why is it an issue that I want to talk about it?!” He snarls, quietly, turning himself to face her and finds fleeting anger in those oceanic depths, “Am I your entertainment now? Is this how you vet me for trustworthiness?”

“I already told you—“

“I’m like Liam? No the fuck I’m not. He’s easily one of the most honorable, trustworthy people I’ve been graced to serve with and who he was doesn’t dust the surface of what I’m not.”

Dain sighs and looks back down at the dais. He can’t follow the class discussion now. What was he even thinking, considering pursuing Sloane? It was the farthest thing from a naturally occurring relationship. She lost her only living family because of him. He looks at her from the corner of his eye,

“Is that it? I’m just a convenient creature comfort? Then you go back to treating me like you know you should?”

“I didn’t think about,” she inhales deeply, “—about how you’d feel. I didn’t expect to—”

“To be wrapped up against me and think I wouldn’t think anything of it?” He smashes his ink pen down on his notebook and the ink vial cracks, black seeps into the pages, “Thank you Sloane. Keep me humble.” He sneers.

“Do you hear how you’re talking to me, you wont even let me finish?” She pushes, leaning towards him.

“Like my junior?” He clips, he’s done with this conversation.

“Like you hate me.”

His head snaps down at her, “I do not hate you.”

“Then why are treating me like I’m a burden?!”

Dain narrows his eyes, “_I’m_ treating _you_ like a burden? Coming to your room at the odd hours of the night and pressing my fucking skin against yours? Waking up with me clinging to you like you’re my _lover_? Not sure what kind of man you take me for Mairi, but I’m not the type to lead people on.”

Her face immediately flares scarlet and she glances behind him, “I didn’t think that—,”

“Exactly. You don’t think. You just do.” He grumbles scathingly.

“I didn’t think you’d get in the bed with me! I thought you’d just keep sleeping at your desk! And when you did come to bed I thought you’d sleep at the edge, or push me away when I…” Her face could not possibly get anymore flushed, and she grabs the arm of his chair, “It’s nice having someone hold you!” She sputters.

He raises a hand in denial, “Yes, okay. Find someone in your year to hold you Mairi.”

Her head falls down and he looks at the tops of her braids.

“No.” She mutters, “I won’t.”

He rolls his neck in irritation and leans away from her. What he wouldn’t give to have someone actually _want_ to hold him. To have someone to love and protect, to have an explanation that couldn’t possibly exist within the realms of modern languages to describe the lengths he would go to keep them safe and sated. Riorson’s emotions surface from the remnants of his memory and Dain exhales.

“Suit yourself. There’s four weeks till War Games and you and I will be adhering to the Codex properly and purposefully. If I catch you out past curfew there will be consequences. Once I graduate there won’t be a reason for us to speak.”

“No,” she whispers again, but this time she grabs his arm.

“Get off of me, the whole Wing is here.” He grunts, jerking his arm away.

She’s quiet the rest of the class.

---

During Flight Tactics & Maneuvers he and Cath put on a show that leaves their instructors open-mouthed and sweating.

_“Is it not often that riders use a dragon’s wings to mount?"_ He asks while sprinting towards Cath from behind. His tail is as flat and level as he can manage when Dain slides across its surface and he plants his feet firmly against Cath’s scales, grabbing hold with his hands and tucking his fingers between them in a squat. As he feels his tail lift upwards and curve he asks for Malek’s favor, pulling his flight goggles down at the last possible second as Cath launches him from the tip of his tail into the sky across the valley. Two gryphons pass underneath him as Cath dips for the valley floor, one of the fliers fling a heavy dagger at him which he catches as his body curves into a fatal descent. Cath flattens out beneath him and he lands facing the swordtail’s hind legs just behind his seat.

_“No, generally it is seen in extreme disgust to have the rider mount in anyway besides climbing.”_ Cath answers, _“But each relationship between rider and dragon is their own discretions.”_

_“Makes sense.”_

“Good!” Dain shouts, “That was perfect!”

The fliers bank at opposite directions of each other and settle beneath Cath as his wingbeats slow and allow them to catch up, tucked in close to his forelegs and clacking their beaks together. They seemed equally pleased and the fliers both give him a thumbs up.

_“Can you tell them to wait one for the next formation?”_ Dain asks Cath through their bond.

_“They obey.”_ he says after a beat.

In the valley beneath them houses a motley of dragons who wait for their turn to repeat his groups techniques with their riders and fliers alike. It was suggested during an assembly meeting that riots and drifts began incorporating themselves as a singular unit, operating in tandem rather than cooperating individually. Dain can’t agree more; the fluidity in tactic leaves for less blind spots and casualties. He’s the first to volunteer for _spoken_ descriptions of new flight formations; Cath is always willing to participate if it means showing off no matter what the risk is. Dain checks his peripherals as two more pairs of fliers join their formation with Cath and himself in the center.

_“Are you sure you’re okay with the next movement?”_ Dain presses, pushing his uncertainty in the winds of their battlefield.

_“I am not too proud to increase the chances that you live, Knight, albeit I am not eager for this one.”_ Cath blows the winds back, and their battle flag trembles in the bond. The swordtail is confident.

_“Heard."_

“CLIMB!” Dain bellows when he sees the glint of signifying light below, his voice drops impossible octaves as he uses lesser magic to amplify his command across the formation.

The gears of the group move like they’ve been greased and practiced for decades. The two gryphons at Cath’s forelegs drop altitude with them and hold their place while the other four ascend in a neatly stacked formation, their wings beat vigorously as they climb above Cath’s body. The swordtail lurches forward putting the two beneath his body at the base of his tail. They wait for the signifying screech from the gryphons above before Cath twists midflight in an impossible display of bodily control and speed, rising beneath the four above him and curving his shoulders as his scales just _barely_ touch their talons. He spreads his carnelian wings and levels for moments before breaking the altitude in a decline that builds monumental speed after just seconds. Dain watches the air split against Cath’s taloned wingtips before refocusing,

“LAUNCH!” He commands, throwing an arm up and over his head,

_“Okay Cath, Calm.”_

Cath grumbles an acknowledgment as he flips between wingbeats and effectively launches the gryphons at once as they collide with his body and ricochet off of him with their wings tucked against their bodies. Once the circular motion is completed Cath flies upwards at an angle that forces Dain to shove his body against the red’s. He manages to steal a glance and sees the gryphons fields ahead of themselves before vertigo sends his peripherals spinning.

_“It worked!”_ Dain shouts down the bond, recovering from the flip,

_“Yes, but one flier struggles to readjust at the speed.”_ Cath states, jerking his body downwards, _“Catch her!”_

Dain processes the information as it reaches his ears, tucking his body even closer to Cath’s as they bullet downwards beneath a flier whose gryphon twists and falls awkwardly in the air, screeching in panic as its clawed feet try to grab for her flier at the same time.

It’s _Cat_.

_“I don’t have the clearance to break her fall gently!”_ Cath roars, _“She is going to fall against you; you must keep your seat on impact!”_

_“Go! I’m ready!”_ Dain commands.

He has milliseconds in between his response to Cath as Cat’s back plummets against his chest and empties whatever air was in his lungs. He feels her weight in his spine as he squeezes her against his chest with one arm, her body immediately assumes a fetal position and she’s hyperventilating. Dain tucks his hand far into Cath’s scales as his wings flare outwards and they stream over the tops of the observing professors and riders who duck to avoid his ruby talons. He only needs to beat against the air once to soar back towards the clouds where the other gryphons, including Cat’s, wait in the neat paradigm meant to include her following a successful evolution.

“That was scary,” Dain chuckles when she finally looks up to see who catches her, “Can you tell Kira to level out over Cath’s wings so we can get you back in your seat?”

Cat looks equally horrified and reassured, “You’re not taking me down?!” She snaps,

“No. We caught you, you’re going back in formation. This is a completed evolution. We’ll debrief after to figure out what went wrong. Realistically, if I brought you down venin could be there waiting to drain us.”

Her eyes soften as she passes the request to Kira.

“You’re gonna have to be quick, but if you run along the bone of Cath’s wing you can hop right back on. Tell her she needs to be towards the center of his wing, by the talon.”

“I can’t.” Cat breathes, lifting herself up in his lap and staring at Cath’s horns, “He’ll drop me! Dragon’s—!”

_“No need to worry about me dropping her if she slips and falls. And I will not retrieve her a second time.”_ Cath threatens,

“He won’t,” Dain says gently, he grabs her chin and turns her face to his and not the rocking land beneath them, “Trust us. I’m your wingleader, and I would never drop you.”

He feels her teeth clench against his hands and she nods, they stand up together as Kira lowers herself just above Cath’s wing, “Go! Go!” Dain shouts, holding her hand as she advances until she lets go herself. He watches as her ink black braid whips furiously in the wind and Kira cries for her, attempting to keep herself as centered as possible while beating her wings. She’s mid-wing when she crouches just enough to jump onto Kira’s back and Cath bucks upwards to the formation with Dain reseated and Kira and Cat following close behind. They hold proper formation as Cath makes them complete the circuit again to shake off the anxiety and land immediately after.

“Bravo!” Felix cheers as they dismount, “That was damn excellent Aetos, that felt like watching Sgaeyl and Xaden!”

_“We. Are. Better.”_ Cath hisses, blazing dragon fire into the air.

Dain rolls his eyes, “Thank you.” He tells Felix as the rest of Iron Squad comes racing up the valley where the formation landed,

“Cat! Holy shit what happened!?” Matthias gasps,

“Save it for debrief,” Professor Kiandra snaps, “Everyone in the theatre right now!”

_“See you later?”_ Dain says to Cath, waving.

_“If you wish.”_

He stands there watching as his peers stream past him, breaking around him like water. They feed him words of encouragement and praise, but it falls on deaf ears as he watches Cath’s maroon body tighten and then spring into the sky, slicing through the air and leaving streamed lines as evidence of his impressive strength and speed in his wake.

“Aetos!”

He whips his head around at Cat’s voice, “Cat?”

She’s shadowed by Maren and their gryphons.

“Thank you, so much.” She says breathlessly, “I was going to die.”

“No you weren’t.” He grits out, “No one dies on my watch.”

“Thank you so much Aetos, really. I couldn’t breathe when Kira lost her balance,”

“It’s fine,” he gestures at the horde of fading students, “Let’s head in?”

Cat and Maren exchange a look of exasperation and they take a spot at either side of him and accompany him back to Riorson House in relative silence. As they file into the theatre Professor Kiandra and Devera and two other assembly members join Felix at a table filled with lesson plans.

“Aetos,” Kiandra begins, lesser magic carry her voice up to the top row of seats that he placed himself in, “Care to explain the two flight formations introduced today?”

He’s still getting situated in his seat when he begins to speak, “A rearming exchange, and then a climb and launch.”

“How did you feel about them?” She asks, pacing on the dais as his peers turn in their seats to watch as he speaks,

“Fine. Rearming exchange will allow everyone to stay supplied with alloy daggers as whoever instructed in a unit retrieves daggers without drawing any attention to themselves. Mine and Cath’s was just…”

“Irrational?” She smirks,

“A personal test. Faster, and better.” He deadpans, returning the a raised lip back to her.

“And the climb and launch?”

“There’s a few variables we need to consider with that.” Dain muses,

“Anyone want to chance those?” Kiandra cuts in, gesturing to the rows of fliers and riders,

“Wether the dragon will agree to be used as a launching pad,” Cat responds confidently, you wouldn’t be able to tell she was falling hundreds of feet in the air previously by looking, “And if said dragon is fast, strong, and big enough to preform the maneuver.”

“And should Cath be the poster dragon of this maneuver Catriona?”

“Absolutely.” Cat responds, back straight, vision tunneled on the professor, “He launched four gryphon across the entire valley and… caught me.”

“I won’t lie Cat, I’ve never seen a flier touch a dragon before, let alone _run across their wing.”_ Trissa adds from her seat next to Felix, “Seems Aetos has a formidable relationship with his. All of you should strive for that level of understanding with your bonds.”

Dain crosses his leg over his knee.

_"You're being praised to the high heavens.”_

_“As I should be.”_ Cath preens.

“It was horrifying.” Cat continues, sighing, "But I’m grateful. And again I find myself in Navarr—,”

“Tyrrendor’s.” Dain corrects her almost immediately.

Cat whips her head around to look at him, as does the rest of Iron Squad and he swears he sees a smile flit across Sloane’s face before hiding behind Lynx’s shoulder.

“Tyrrendor’s.” He repeats himself.

The assembly members eyebrows are about ready to leave their skin as he shrugs at Cat.

“King Tecarus will surely hear of this, we are fortunate to have such merciful peers here in Tyrrendor’s.” Maren concludes and Kiandra continues with the lecture.

After Battle Brief, which flight tactics and maneuvers transitioned into seamlessly, Cat finds Dain again; she’s her normal self now that the shock is gone.

“I want to tell your dragon thank you.” She tells him, although it feels more like a demand, “Is he busy?”

_“I am fed.”_ Cath yawns.

“He’s not.” Dain tells her, “We can go now if you want.”

She nods and they meet Cath in the courtyard.

He towers over Cat curiously; Cath is different from other dragons in a cat-like sense. It really just depends on the day with him but Dain always considered him more considerate and approachable than others like himself. He watches as his swordtail cranes his neck downwards so that Cat is dangerously close to his nostrils. Her body language shifts several times before she takes a step towards him.

“He seems tolerant.” Cat says to Dain, “Is he?”

“…Just of me.” He admits, he takes a seat on the steps above them to the far left of the fortified doors so he’s not sitting in the way of those coming in and out of the fortress.

She speaks to Cath so softly that he can’t hear the one-sided conversation. Eventually her foreign features break into a beautiful smile as Cath snorts at her and she takes a step back to bow at him, then turns to Dain.

“I believe he’s tolerant of me as well.” She sings, chin held high.

Dain lets himself really laugh, and his whole body shakes, “I think he is too Cat.”

“Well,” she begins, unbraiding her hair since Cath has effectively ruined its typically neat doing, “Dinner is going to be served shortly, come eat.”

“I think—,”

“Come. Eat.” She repeats, gesturing to the inside of Riorson House, “Because I know you haven’t been.”

He huffs an indignant breath at her and shakes his head, but follows her as she passes him.

“You should try to meet your squad halfway. They’re trying.”

“I know. I just haven’t been feeling well and the days are just mixing together. I want a break Cat.”

She lessens her pace until they’re walking next to each other and their strides even out, “We’re fighting a war Aetos." she says with her chin high, "There are no breaks.”

_“I like this one too.”_ Cath tells him through the bond.

Riorson House’s newly finished Dining Hall is masterfully erected from stone like the rest of the fortress. The ceilings are vaulted and two stories tall with windows that climb from the floor till the ornate rafters begin. The tables are heavy and wooden and stretch most of the length of the venue in repeated placements with individual chairs to match.

“Wow,” Dain says to Cat, “This is nicer than anything at Basgiath.”

“Wouldn’t it be nice to just stay here?” She wonders with him, “The food is better too. But I miss Cliffsbane.”

“What was it like?” 

They stand in a line that stretches well into the Great Hall and some passing fliers give Dain and Cat friendly salutes,

“Cliffsbaine?” She looks at him and then past him, “It was built along a cliff, obviously, in an area that could be considered a generational nesting ground for the gryphons. Always warm, and smelled like sea salt. We had three main buildings: one for runes, flight, and combat, and each had different branches. I think Xaden is the only rider that’s been.”

“He went to Cliffsbaine?” Dain gapes, “For what?”

“A tour. When we were… otherwise involved with each other regularly it was encouraged by my uncle. He didn’t have his dragon then, and the unbonded gryphons liked him a lot.”

“I can’t picture this at all.”

Cat laughs, and the sound rings in his ears like bells, “Believe it or not there was clutch of black gryphons born a decade before and one of them stalked us until we reached the palace again. He followed Xaden around like a dog until he had to leave back to Tyrrendor.”

Nausea rolls over him and he staggers a bit, but he’s more or less prepared for the onslaught of unsolicited memories that blink across is mind. He sees Xaden with the massive midnight colored gryphon, Cat watches from behind a pillar as he shoos it away. He’s wearing a pure white tunic and heavy brown boots, standing close to a glowing pool of water.

“Are you okay?” She asks, tilting her head slightly,

"Sorry, yeah." He pinches the bridge of his nose, praying the feeling away,

“Did you see that?”

“See what?” He feigns stupidly,

“My memory of Xaden.” She hisses, “Don’t play stupid you told us all yesterday.”

Dain flinches, “I did. I’m sorry.”

He waits for her to take off in disgust but she shrugs instead. They’re close to the entrance of the Dining Hall and plates are passed down the line.

“Do you think you’ll be able to control it eventually?” She begins curiously, “I thought you had always been able to.”

“I did.” He screws his face up, “But since it’s evolving… I can’t. I don’t even know when its going to happen, I just feel it coming.”

“What does it feel like?”

“Like I’m going to throw up.”

She turns away from him to receive food from the serving staff after shooting him a pitiful glance.

“So that time we were training Sloane’s signet? When you crawled away from Imogen?”

He winces, he never realized how perceptive Cat was, “That time too.”

After his plate is filled she leads them to a table in the far right of the hall where the usual crew eats with some fliers he hadn’t met before and sits in a seat clearly meant for her next to Maren. He stands there with his plate, stupidly staring at the two of them.

“Sit down? Unless you want to eat standing, I don’t care.” Cat spits,

“Gods Cat, you’re acting like the man didn’t save your life like two hours ago.” Sawyer teases,

“Cath save my life.” She snaps, “And I just finished telling him thank you.”

“Aetos is his rider, he deserves a thank you as much as Cath does.” Sloane pipes up from between Violet and Imogen.

Cat cocks her head to the right in a manner a gryphon would, “And I told him thank you as well, we even had a _lovely_ conversation Sloane.” she purrs,

“Is that sarcasm?” Sawyer asks, waving his fork at them, “Cat you don’t converse with shit.”

“She talked to us, it was nice of her.” Dain says, cutting into his lamb.

“Us?” Sawyer repeats, lifting a brow and jerking his neck towards Dain,

“She talked to Cath in the courtyard.”

“About what? How?” Sawyer presses with lifted brows,

“Did he say anything back?” Violet asks, astonished.

“Dunno, he didn’t tell me anything besides ‘I like this one.’”

“Of course he would.” Cat sings, dipping her shoulders once each before turning her head to Dain, “He must recognize royalty.”

_“Fearless One.”_ Cath barks, rumbling an amused laugh down the bond.

“Gods the two of you are insufferable, this was a mistake.” Dain groans.

“What’d he say?” Cat asks excitedly.

He rolls his head over at Cat and then his eyes.

She frowns and puts her fork down to tuck her hair behind her ears, “Tell me.” She insists.

“He called you ‘fearless one’.”

She looks so proud of herself Dain can’t help but laugh.

“You seem like you’re feeling better,” Violet says,

“I like tactics and flight maneuvers.” He admits, “Felt nice to unnecessarily risk my life in the sky on orders.”

“Never pegged you for a masochist.” Ridoc teases through a mouthful of food, “You seem more like the do-what-I-say type.”

Dain looks at him, “Being told what to do beats thinking. Apparently I’m not too good at that.”

“Maybe in your personal life,” Matthias disagrees, “You had the formation locked down, without a prior demonstration and only with a verbal explanation. That’s not something casually achieved.”

“_Wingleader.”_ He mocks sarcastically.

“Deserved.” Matthias shrugs.

“Kiandra and Felix nearly shit themselves watching.” Ridoc continues, “Cat you almost had that woman in tears.”

Dain busies himself with his dinner. It’s _amazing_, the lamb is cooked tender and charred sparingly, it’s served with an artichoke salad and dehydrated figs under a vinaigrette dressing.  
    
“Why don’t your instructors attempt to intervene when there’s the possibility of a training causality?” Cat snarls, “I’m pissed that they were going to just watch me die.”

“Intervene?” Ridoc sneers, “Cat, we can’t make our dragons save anyone. I’d say your lucky Cath and Aetos are close.”

“Was it you, or Cath?” Cat presses, whipping her body around to ask, “Did you want to save me?”

Dain finishes swallowing his food before speaking.

“Cath noticed Kira struggling and then saw you fall. When he told me I was pressed to the saddle so I didn’t get ripped out my seat.”

“When he told you what exactly?” She pushes,

“That I had seconds to prepare to catch you and keep my seat afterwards.” Dain shovels the salad into his mouth, “I already told you, no one dies on my watch when I can help it. Cath shares the same sentiment; we don’t need each other’s permission to do the right thing Cat—rider or flier, it doesn't matter.”

Cat is quiet but only for a moment.

“I hope you all feel like _shit_ for ostracizing him.”
