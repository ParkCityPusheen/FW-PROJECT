“Sawyer!”

She can hear the voices of her seniors all around her, sees her year-mates helping those crushed under the rubble of Cath’s rampage as he fights—losing—but challenging Codagh in the settling skies. Rain no longer pours—it mists, soft and clinging, steaming where Sawyer melts the metal binds fused to their wingleader’s skin.

There’s no way to remove the restraints without them burning against his skin, so Sawyer does what he can to get Dain out of the chair. 

"Dain, I'm so sorry. I know this hurts like a bitch, man, we're getting you out of here now—I promise."

Sawyer's eyes glaze further as the seconds tick by until tears silently roll down his face.

They groan together as he and Rhiannon heave their senior over a pool of his own blood, thinned by rain, to a spot that Cat and Bragen have cleared of rubble.

Dain’s body convulses with each of his breaths. Steam rises from the open wounds where the metal binds have fused to his skin, and where Sawyer peels them back, strips of flesh come with them. She can see the bone in one arm. The other hangs useless, somehow more than the other—bent backwards at the elbow like a snapped wing.

The tragedy that his life may end befalls Sloane as she watches Dain writhe. Regret nearly suffocates her as Iron Squad works to lift him—carefully, slowly—each movement calculated, trying to get his arms in a way that didn't leave him screaming.

The world around her dulls at the edges. The rain, the shouting, the shifting of bodies—it all feels too far away. Like it’s happening on the other side of a pane of glass. Her chest tightens slowly, steadily, until there’s no space left to draw breath without effort. Her hands shake at her sides, her legs feel wrong beneath her. 

She had pushed him away at every turn, afraid of what it would mean to let him in. He had waited anyway—steadily, quietly, always there. And now—watching him broken and possibly dying—she realizes she might never get the chance to take it back.

A breath shudders out of her.

And then Cat’s voice cuts through the haze.

"We won't be able to avoid causing him more discomfort—or damage," Cat intersects Dain's arms across his chest, she wraps him up like a gift and then turns her head to Rhiannon. Dain howls, and his eyes flicker open for just a moment before slamming shut again.

Cat slides her hands down the sides of her face as she assesses him.

"We need to prioritize keeping him breathing. There's no damage to his neck or spine, thankfully." she looks around the courtyard, grimaces at the groaning of cadets and professors trapped under rubble, "I worry that they won't treat him because of what Cath's done."

Maren as usual, is right next to Cat, "His heart is beating so slowly..."

Bragen holds out his own flight jacket to Cat; it's what they've been using to secure his limbs, "No. The Poromish *need* the Squadron, they're meant to tour our borders after Navarre's. King Tecarus won't overlook anything past the damage that's already been done."

"He isn't here to delegate right now." Cat hisses, "Dain needs to be with us in Aretia."

The argument continues, all the while Sawyer uses his signet to create a rail system that they use to get Dain to the ground floor with.

Avalynn is saying something to her, they're in the courtyard to the right of the administrative building, Sloane teeters. Avalynn is saying something to her—maybe about Dain, maybe about collapsed building—but Sloane can’t latch onto a single word. Her ears throb with static. Everything is too loud and too far away. There's talk of who will transport him to the flight field and what to do from there, but it’s blurry, and everything sounds like it’s underwater.

Rhi's mouth is moving, quickly, while Dain groans his dragon's name underneath them and Cath bellows in response. Their heads turn towards it, and then they're all talking again, but why aren't their words coming out—why can't she hear them?

How are the fliers always so damn calm, and why are they so concerned with a rider?

Oh—*she’s panicking.*

Her breath catches somewhere in her throat, stuck between a sob and a scream. Her hands won’t stop trembling. The taste of metal floods her mouth—she’s bitten her tongue and didn’t even notice.

Everything feels a second behind. Sounds arrive late. Movements blur like ink blotting across wet parchment.

_How could she?_

He tried to open up to her, and she propositioned him instead—he’d been telling her for days, showing her for _weeks_, that she meant something to him. And what had she given him in return? Lip. Arrogance.

How could she stand here as the most worried of all of them when she had mistreated him the most?

And when Cath crashes down next to them as they attempt to load Dain onto the back of Rhi’s Green, it’s his clacking teeth that shake her back to reality. Feirge doesn't step away, her scales flare and she blinks at Rhiannon,

“Cath, _please!_” Rhi screams after catching herself against her dragon, “He needs help, now!”

She places her hands ahead of her, palms outstretched towards Cath—he's nearly slanted, bleeding, and clearly fighting exhaustion.

Behind him Codagh holds strong, wounded, but not nearly the mess Cath is.

”I’m going to find Violet, she's got ahold of Nolon, can you get him to the flight field?” Ridoc grits,

Rhi levels a look on Cath, “If his dragon lets me.”

Ridoc nods and takes off across the courtyard for the Scribe Quadrant's access area to the school building.

Beneath them Dain _screams._ There’s nowhere to properly handle him; his skin is blotted and bleeding, broken as the bones in his arms. Sloane shakes her head, rubs her eyes with the heel of her palms; right, she thinks, Nolon.

Mender.

*Fix him.*

When did Ridoc get there?

“Cath.” She stumbles forward, almost slipping on the wet grass. “Thoirt and I can help.”

For a moment, there's nothing besides his unblinking eyes. Then—

Cath snarls through his teeth, dragging air in ragged bursts that shake the earth around them. The ground beneath his talons splits with each step. His injured wings sag, soaked and torn. Still—he plants himself between Dain and Codagh, his body a wall of molten defiance, but he lets them tend his rider.

Sloane nods to Rhi,

“On Thoirt—,” she gasps, “—flight field.”

As they fly for the flight field with Dain leaned against the front of her body in the seat, Codagh’s silhouette looms behind the rubble—still, unshaken. Observing. Calculating.

...*Waiting.*

---

There’s no time to cry, but she does.

Sloane cries, and cries, and *cries.*

In fact, she's cried so much its drawn odd looks from several of her squad mates. She doesn't entertain it, can't really with Thoirt's emotions suffocating her like a warm bog over a southern swampland; their ethos have braided together and developed lines that probably wouldn't redefine into properly maintained boundaries again until tomorrow. 

Cath only followed immediately after seeing Thoirt launch ahead—manic and bloodthirsty, yes, but even more unwilling to let Dain out of his sight. When Nolon arrives he's hesitant to mend with Cath's teeth glistening only feet away from his throat, but eventually he begins.

When he's been mended enough to barely breathe normally, he curses Nolon in his last moments of consciousness:

“Get the fuck away from me.” He snarls, hardly, then faints momentarily before coming back delirious.

Nolon looks the most ragged she's ever seen him, and Dain's denial of treatment makes the older man shake so hard his own dragon growls in the space above them where his brown wings beat roughly against the air. Violet lifts her head, eyes narrowed and face blanched.

He tends to Dain again in this moment of deliriousness. Any bleeding stops, and his breaths no longer sound like a curtain flapping against a half-open window.

"It's only momentary," Nolon pants,

Dain's mouth moves, but to say what—she can’t tell. His words are rushed, just a desperate call of Cath’s name mixed in with whimpers of desperation and other things. His brown hair is matted, void of the confusing golden-blonde sheen it typically carries; its darkest tones surfacing when wet, anyway and she can’t help but to liken it to his wavering health.

"He will make the flight to Aretia, but you must tell the mender there he must work him with the utmost caution."

She catches Nolon squeaking this to Violet; he's terribly wounded for his age.

"What the hell do you mean it's only *momentary?*" Violet snaps, "Did you, or did you not mend him Nolon?!"

Cath is in no greater shape; stumbling sideways, and falling with a sharp warble; Dòrainn slips underneath the swordtail in just enough time to shoot upwards and keep him from crushing Dain and herself, and the others gathered around them, while attempting to stay upright. 

His right wing seems horribly strained, and seconds away from snapping, and he refuses to let his den-mates near, calling to Dain underneath him with echoing cries and dripping snarls against the trembling thunder that claps above them all.

She wonders if Dain’s inclination to Dòrainn is why Cath let’s the older Red so close, and her heart squeezes when Cath jerks away from Thoirt—who he typically receives in casual manner—and her dragon releases a broken *whine.* Thoirt's emotions are laid out for Sloane to feel clearly yet again.

Guilt, and helplessness, and *affection.*

They watch together as Cath launches with Dain secured in the seat, awkwardly; he breathes crimson red flames into the pounding rain as he ascends with Dòrainn tucked underneath them, Thoirt and Sliseag are visibly impatient to join their den-mates.

"Is there a reason we can't mend him fully here?" Cat snaps, face inches away from Nolon's,

"He was administered a... an elixir not quite approved yet. One—one in works you see, if he's mended too soon and too quickly the consequences could—"

Sawyer chokes, "Why would you ever create something like that and use it one of your *students?*"

Cat whips around to face him,

"I've been saying this since I met Riorson: this place is a fucking offering grounds to Malek—inhabited by the least human citizens I've met in my damn life."

She opens her mouth to say something else but Maren and Bragen pull her to the side, Cat seems like she might cry for Dain too, like herself and Sawyer—and nearly Violet, when she turns away and sees the youngest Sorrengail watching her.

"He won't fall?" Sloane gapes while watching Cath and Dòrainn's crooked flight,

*"He is secured by Cath, don't worry."* Thoirt responds, and though her tone is that of reassurance, her emotions are tattered, *"Their biggest challenge has been overcome."*

"Sloane," Violet begins as she passes by to Andarna, "I'll give as much of my magic as you need to keep him above water once we get back, so *please* don't leave his side."

Her eyes narrow, "I wasn't planning on it."

Violets gaze drops, "I shouldn't have."

"What do you mean? You were with him before this happened?" Sloane bites,

"For a bit, yes. We were talking about something. About somethings."

Sloane's head cocks to the side and suddenly she can understand the angle Violet goes from in regard to Xaden—the one that risks absolutely everything else if the benefit is in his interest. If it were Sloane about Dain, she wouldn't give up information either—she knows they're childhood friends but part of her wants to scream *you can't have them both!* 

She turns away from Violet in a show of self control.

Sloane doesn’t dare ask Thoirt whether she believes the two will be okay, she doesn’t allow the thought to fester even a second before mixing the only bits of optimism that exists in her heart in mind through the halls of their bond,

*”They must.”* She declares to Thoirt.

*”They will.”* Thoirt assures Sloane.

When they arrive to Aretia hours later, Brennan appears seconds after Cath crashes into Riorson House’s courtyard, nearly barreling into the front of the fortress, howling into the clear Tyrrish skies. Violet blathers off the information that Nolon had given them in his panic and Brennan’s face darkens.

Cath allows the oldest Sorrengail to scale him, where he spends nearly ten minutes to carefully mend only parts of Dain’s collapsed lung.

“Get out of my way.” He barks at them with his body tucked against his chest, face blotted and covered with sweat already.

He begins walking up the stairs and apparently they haven’t cleared out fast enough because the bellow Cath blankets across the courtyard scares birds out of tree in the mountaintops *miles* away; he successfully causes the dispersion of rider and dragon alike. 

*”Go with him.”* Thoirt tells Sloane, *”You will be needed.”*

She hesitates, only a moment before Cath’s head swivels to her—Thoirt drops her own in warning—and Cath’s widened, bloodied eyes pierce through her and then her daggertail.

*”Go.”* Thoirt urges.

---

”Second floor.”

“By Her Grace?”

Sloane watches Brennan mull over where he’s having Dain moved to with an expressionless face; they’re both sweaty and tired. Mira is asleep in a heavy armchair placed at the base of Dain’s cot and nearly drained of her magic, and Cat and Kai feebly make their exit under the same circumstance.

“Sloane, you’ve done a great job.” Kai tells her while pulling her into a tight embrace,

She hugs him back, breathes in his sweet scent when she shoves her face into his collarbone, “Thank you for volunteering to help.”

“He saved Cat; he’s helped me a lot this year, and never looked down on me or made me feel anything less than he would a rider. I look up to him.” Kai admits, smiling sheepishly.

"What do you think..." she begins, eyes flicking to Brennan, "...happens now that the damage is done."

Kai watches Cat disappear into the infirmary hallway, "I'm sure Navarre has as much say in this as we do in anything regarding the gryphons."

"None." Sloane remarks,

"Exactly."

Sloane’s lips quiver.

"What happens when they survive this just to be in danger because of it."

Kai pulls her into a tight hug, and speaks softly.

"He doesn't talk to you guys about things, but the fliers talk. Hive mind. And we *need* him Sloane; Basgiath's General will not be going unpunished."

She wonders if he’d be uninjured if he had more support like this openly—maybe if Basgiath recognized him the way the flyers did, if he had been anything besides a fall man for the past year. She hadn’t known what kind of help Kai had gotten from Dain, nor the kind of success Cat had with him in their signet training. She hadn’t considered it; how much he extended himself for the sake of others.

How he always put someone else first.

How it was never himself.

Suddenly the room smells too clean; healers are shuffling around them, cleaning blood off the floor and Dain—sanitizing so they can do what they need to. Her eyes sting as the chemicals are exposed to the open air and she opens her mouth to drink down.

Brennan’s voice marches through her thoughts and Sloane refocuses,

“—suite at the end of the familial quarters.”

She shakes off the thoughts and wipes at tears that threaten to prickle at the corner’s of her eyes, shoves Kai out of Dain’s intensive care room after Cat then waits for Brennan’s tired eyes to meet her own.

“You’ve done impressively well today for someone who doesn’t use her signet,” he exhales while removing his uniform top.

He might’ve meant for it to be a lighthearted joke but Sloane can only receive his statement as an insult and her blue irises collides with Brennan's amber ones.

“I *use* my signet.” Sloane bites, narrowing her eyes, she gestures at Mira asleep in a coating of her own sweat, “As you can see.”

Brennan doesn’t reply, he only rests a hand against Dain’s forehead and brushes the hair away that curls over it, “I see, Mairi.”

“I’m staying with him.” She declares.

He only glances down at her before shuffling out of them room and retreating to his office at the front of the infirmary, just before it’s entrance where an armed watch is always posted.

She follows him.

“I’m only allowing it because we may need you in a pinch—Cath isn’t,” he snaps his mouth shut and sighs, "—look I’m not inclined to share the details of what’s happening with the two of them to you, but I’m aware you’re a necessity in his recovery.”

He pauses, then pulls out several papers from canvassed journals and begins a medical synopsis,

“Report to your leadership. You aren’t in my chain of command, and yes, while he’s critically injured he’s now been stabilized; until further notice you’re dismissed.”

Sloane bites her tongue while thinking of Dain; Brennan’s formality wasn’t allowing the room for rebuttal, and the consequences of poor military bearing might cost her an opportunity to stay by his side.

She takes her chances; for him. 

"What happens if there's an emergency. What if you need me again?" she sputters,

Brennan raises a reddish brow, "Then you'll be sent for, Cadet Mairi."

"And if I end up being sent back to Basgiath?"

"Then you'll go." he barks, then gestures to the door of his office.

She winces.

“Yes, Lieutenant Colonel,” she responds solemnly before ducking out of Brennan’s office and back to Dain’s room once more.

Sloane watches from the doorway as a group of healers cut away the remnants of his clothes and wipe his body with a damn cloth the way he had for her the night she almost had him. Their hands work with learned expertise, careful over sutures, thorough where dirt and grime has caked into his wounds. Another goes behind the one with a rag, he has a pair long, thin steel tweezers that pull the rubble from his exposed flesh.

They scribble notes on clipboards and grimace while doing so—one woman’s lips tremble when lifting his arms and he winces and groans even in his sleep.

Even with the strongest anti-pain agent Brennan had, tranquilizers, and inhibitors; all things she listened to Brennan demand aggressively while mending him to a stable condition. 

Dain still needed surgery.

He till couldn’t be mended *properly* because of some concoction of poisons and magic.

Sloane sucks in agonizing breath as if she’s the one on that cot, still bleeding and broken, and anger fills her lungs more than oxygen could ever wish to.

She blinks away tears while gripping the doorframe tight. 

Her rage infuses into her blood, bites at the pores of her skin, steals away room for anything besides aching vengeance. He was barely clinging to life, and his father was somewhere at Basgiath, probably comfortable.

Probably not bleeding, and certainly not *broken.*

It wasn’t justice she wanted—it was blood. Sloane didn’t care how. Didn’t care what it made her. She just needed to be the one to take his father apart, piece by fucking piece.

She didn’t want it quick. She didn’t want it clean. She wanted him to suffer so completely, so slowly, that death would feel like a kindness he'd never earned. She would skin him alive, cut the flesh from his bones, and then grind them to dust; General Aetos would be so unrecognizable by the time she was finished with him there wouldn’t be a body to burn—no reason a soul should be commended to Malek.

Not that the fucker ever had one to begin with.

---

For some reason she foolishly thinks there will be a kind moment of relief when she joins the rest of Fourth Wing in the theatre; Maiselle and Rhiannon stand before their peers on the stage with Violet not far behind, cutting at the edge of the makeshift desk behind them.

“You want us to *return* to Basgiath as if our commanding officer didn’t just try to murder our wingleader for shits and giggles?”

Sloane doesn’t look to see who groans in protest as she joins second squad, squeezing past Imogen and between Lynx and Avalynn,

“We’ve recovered our objective here.” Maiselle bites sharply, her voice is rough and edged; she’s goading them, daring them to test her,

“Protesting because of what happened to our wingleader does nothing for anyone—especially him. Now’s the chance to show the brass just how well his wing functions under pressure, and against cruelty.”

Violet stands and slowly brings herself to stand next to Rhiannon; she looks exhausted.

“I won’t be returning to Basgaith with you all.” She murmurs, then waits for the protests snuff completely,

“I’m submitting a pardoning, and I will complete my time as Cadet under the instruction of veterans fliers and leadership here in Aretia.”

Sloane surveys the room; Imogen’s eyes are widened, but she doesn’t seem surprised. She's also covered in dirt from helping evacuate victims underneath rubble. Every flier looks ready to mount their gryphons and return to Poromiel while the riders sit white knuckled and teeth bared,

“I can’t trust Basgaith.” Cat speaks, quickly, before the groaning and protest can begin.

She uses lesser magic and swallows the room whole with her voice, “It's not a safe environment for fliers—Lieutenant Colonel Kingston and the two riders from Squadron Zero have departed to report the circumstances to King Tecarus.”

“Cat you can’t—,” Violet begins to push back.

Sloane floats in uncertainty; Dain's injured and now subject of punishment for reason's beyond them, subjected to whatever his father had in plan for his son. She's not sure Violet stepping away from Basgiath was in response to what happened with Dain, and Cat declaring a withdrawal of fliers' attendance to Basgiath over *one* rider was equally as shocking.

She blinks at the speed of the unraveling happening around her. 

Cat sneers, flares out her hip and slams her palm against it.

“I can *actually,* and so I will. All fliers will remain in Tyrrendor until further notice.”

Violet’s eyes narrow, “It feels like just yesterday you were attacking me under the proclamation that you couldn’t trust *me.*”

“Unfortunately Sorrengail, you’ve never once attempted to harm me for fun, and neither has *he,* nor had Dain and I refuse to train in a facility that harms its own students—family, no less.“

Sloane flinches; Lynx squeezes her hand.

“—usually I would say this has nothing to do with us, but it has *everything* to do with us. Riorson is no longer here, which means the next person who regards our best interest is *you.* And respectfully, your Grace, if you aren’t willing to stay neither am I.”

“I’m not pulling out because I’m not comfortable; I have to tend the Province, I’m severely underprepared.” Violet sheathes her dagger, her voice tilts as she validates her decision, “I can’t play student and expect to be a Duchess all at the same time.”

Cat shifts her weight, “I understand that, but all more reason. I’m sure the *master strategist* you’re related to can create a curriculum for fliers the same way Dain committed to his wing, *while* giving specialized training to cadets—“

She gestures to Kai.

“—*while* creating new flight formations for a unit of people who otherwise would never want to work in the paradigms he insanely, and just as successfully delivered. Excuse me for adding—*while* doing research, translations, and anything else *you* asked of him.” Cat breathes,

"Dain Aetos is leading a joint-frontal effort that will bind Tyrrendor and Poromiel for generations. He's believed to be the push we need to send venin back to the Barrens."

She feels pride in Cat’s acknowledgement at Dain’s impressive ability to simply outperform those around him—but there’s no room for it, there’s nothing but *red.*

“Dain’s staying here isn’t he?” Sloane interjects,

“He is.” Violet answers immediately, "And Cat, I understand that, I have a copy of the documentation. Thank you."

“Brennan needs me for his recovery.”

Maiselle turns her head to Sloane, “I’m sure Lieutenant Colonel will grant your return; you can come back right after War Games.”

Rhiannon and Violet nod.

“No—,”

“It’s not a fucking suggestion Mairi.” Maiselle snaps.

Imogen reaches over and presses her palm against the edge of her knee, shaking her head, “You can come back, Solstice is right after graduation.”

Sloane simmers, smacking away Imogen’s hand.

Graduation doesn’t fucking matter.

The *Province* doesn’t matter.

She wants to scream it through the theatre, choke the wing with her aggression—their friend was *dying,* stabilized or not, there were no signs of improvement.

Friend? Lover? She ponders.

Will he even make it through Solstice for that talk?

“I’m not sure when you decided to start following rules and orders,” Sloane rasps; she can hear the lift in her voice, the emotion leaking into it, 

“—but it’s a really interesting fucking time to do it now, Violet.”

Violet bristles, "What would you suggest, Sloane?"

“_Little ole’ me?_” Sloane rasps. “Honestly—nothing. Not like I was included in anything. Or kept up to speed. I was the closest thing Xaden and Bohdi had to a sister outside of Imogen—and I still got shut out. So yeah, go ahead and make part two. This time with Dain.”

"We don't need the fucking sarcasm right now Sloane," Imogen snarls,

*"Focus."* Thoirt hisses in the same tone.

"Cath just destroyed a whole sector of the school, and murdered some unknown number of people in the process. The fliers are dead-set that somehow the two of them get out of this—" she slaps Lynx's hand away and glances back at Aaric,

"I just—is going back there going to help us protect him here?"

Rhiannon steps forward, ahead Maiselle, "Yes. A whole Wing staying behind in the support of one person is ineffective, as for protection; only Cath can offer him that."

"We're getting the message out to the section leaders now; we were originally given two days to collect the information we needed for the decryption so it'll be at their discretion whether or not they return with us."

"—you mean for us to leave now?" Aaric asks from behind her,

Rhi nods, "The sooner the better. Dain's life is in Brennan's hands,"

"There was too much death for us to not." Violet adds, "We should be helping where we can. We all know how the General works by now; he's not my mother. It's never sensible or fair, it's always purely out of spite, or reaching for power. We need to lean into the fact that he's the emotional one—not us. We're a representation of him Sloane."

There's a rumble of agreement,

Maiselle steps forward and her skin lifts, flips—ripples like scales. In moments, she’s not herself. She stands at the center of the stage, honey-brown hair kempt, beard manicured and trimmed, eyes caramel and calm. *He* stands there, the way he should be, in leathers and a cocky smile that she hasn't seen in weeks,

"We have the encrypted code so he'd want us to return anyway."

Even her voice belongs to who it looks like—deep and so fucking *gentle.*

There's gasping through the theatre, "*That's* your signet?"

Maiselle—Dain—shrugs, "Yup. Let's try and keep this a secret." she pokes at the compass beneath her Flame section patch.

"How though?!" A scrawny male from second squad barks, "We've been going in circles! The professors aren't helping enough!"

"You guys think Dain Aetos picked me as an EO for nothing? Cianna couldn't even scratch the surface of his expectations—I *exceeded* them." she says with a disgusted face.

Sloane only sees Dain.

"Leadership means making things work when and where they need to," Maiselle gestures to the section leaders and squad leaders, "*How* doesn't matter when you can rely on each other. A plan was put together and we excelled as a unit; let's keep this momentum we've curated—specifically for Dain. "

Rhi nods, "If anyone or their dragon expects they can't make the flight back, you're welcome to stay. We muster now at the courtyard then launch as a wing; boots on ground at Basgiath and report immediately to leadership where they need us."

There's a collection of *heard* and *tracking.*

Maiselle nods then shifts back, her hazel eyes finds Sloane's glazed blue ones.

"Lets make him proud, yeah?"

---

She escapes away to Dain's room in the infirmary with Aaric after the rest of the squad does—excluding Violet, she excuses herself to *rest.*

He somehow looks worse than before.

There's a tube shoved down his throat, and several other smaller ones protruding from his lung, she shivers and hopes the few others above it aren't in his heart. It's all under a thin gown that he's been changed into. Aaric walks to the edge of his cot and pets Dain's head slowly; it's the only place safe to touch.

He threads his fingers through Dain's hair absentmindedly; the healers have washed it, now his curls lay wet and smell of salt and cedarwoods,

"He wouldn't pick a shampoo with this scent."

Sloane smiles, but it fades as she acknowledges she doesn't even know what kind of scents he likes. The two of them, Aaric and Dain, have proper history. She feels the jealously white-hot and prickling against her skin. Gods what a cruel life this was, a sideliner by trade and in power. 

She wonders coldly when her breakthrough would be.

Her voice breaks over her glass composure as she speaks; Aaric keeps petting his friend, "I don't *know* him, I can't *help* him, but I fucking *want* him—"

"—Not dead?"

"That's not funny," Sloane snaps through tears,

Aaric's laughter is a quick flinch and he sighs while staring down at Dain, "When did this happen? I figured something was up when I opened the door and you were just... there."

"It just *did* Aaric. He spent weeks training me, just trying to get me comfortable with a power he's not even familiar with. Researched and consolidated information for me—the glaive? *His* idea. And when I look back at it all I realize I contributed nothing but stress,"

He watches her as he runs his blunt finger nails along Dain's scalp.

Sloane grips the edge of the cot until her knuckles ache, her nails dig into the steel frame. Her chest tightens with a pressure so deep she’s afraid it might split her in two. Her emotions fold and fold and *fold.*

“I didn’t even know what was happening with Xaden,” she finally whispers. “Everyone had some role—some secret they shared with someone else. I was just… there. One of the only ones who wasn’t pulled into it, like they knew I’d be useless.”

Aaric keeps petting Dain’s loose curls, not interrupting. Not even blinking.

She wipes her face with the sleeve of her jacket, sniffling. “I led him on, Aaric. I wanted him—wanted to feel wanted—but every time he tried to tell me who he was, what he needed, I just shut him down. I made everything harder.”

Aaric finally turns to her. His voice is soft. “Sloane—”

“I feel _helpless._ And selfish. And so fucking _angry._ At myself. At all of this. At Basgiath. At whatever Gods let him survive just to suffer like this.”

A beat passes. Then Aaric breathes out, long and slow, before shaking his head.

“We’re still just kids.”

She blinks at him.

“Even him. *Especially* you. You've been discarded into war games and politics and leadership as if you were being groomed for it like your brother. Sloane you've been sabotaged in the grand scheme of all things and you blame yourself for it everyday.” 

He brushes a bit of hair away from Dain’s forehead with a kind of reverence. “And Dain’s still living in a world that none of us know anything about.”

Sloane’s eyes brim again. She bites her bottom lip.

Aaric leans back in the chair beside the cot. “You didn’t fail him. You’re still here and you’re trying. That’s more than most.”

She stares at him, still trembling.

“The best thing we can do for him right now,” Aaric adds gently, “is to take care of ourselves. Train. Finish what we started. He works best when all the parts around him are moving in the way they're supposed to."

Sloane swallows thickly. “My best is never good enough—"

"Think he'd take you like that?" he grunts, lifting an ashen-brown brow, "Half-assed and afraid of accountability?"

"No."

"Then un-fuck yourself. Take a deep breath and play your pieces; we're operating in a place where life doesn't stop for anyone," he points at Dain in his cot, "if he dies tonight we're still expected in battle brief the day after, Sloane."

She nods, Aaric stands and presses a soft kiss to Dain's forehead—it makes her eyes widen, then he takes her hand in his and begins the trek out of Riorson House and to the valley where the rest of the wing waits for them,

"Now tell me when this *I want him* happened."
