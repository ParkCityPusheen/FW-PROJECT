She spins around and starts at the tie of his pants, she peaks up at him through the flyaways of her braids and her long eyelashes, “Then just let me take care of you,” she insists aggressively, “Please Dain?”

***Please Dain?***

Gods and fucking sinners,

“*Please Dain?*” Cath mocks down the bond,

He’s at the beginning of his pulling his ramparts up to shield out Cath again when a hot wet heat engulfs his erection and he subconsciously bucks into it. Sloane gags underneath him, spitting all over his length, he snaps his gaze downwards at her taking him,

“*By Dunne.*”

He curses; her mouth is too small or his cock is too big, and the sight of those full lips pressed tightly around every vein on his shaft like a watertight gasket makes the remnants of his self control slip away. He grabs the underside of her throat and tips her head back slightly.

“Take it,” he lulls deliriously, almost a whisper, “all of it.”

And he pushes his first few inches down until he feels his tip rub the back of her esophagus, he watches her body jerk, her back arch, her eyes stretch tight as she sputters over his length. He fucks her mouth slow, all the way back and then out so she can breathe. Her eyes are soaking her face and her nose is snotting up like she’s got a cold, but she doesn’t let up and scoots up the mattress to take him *deeper*. He hears a sound behind the ones his cock and her mouth are making and notices her playing with herself, rubbing wildly between her legs.

“Fucking…. *wildcat*.” He grinds out, teeth clenched as his vision begins to fade around the edges. He sucks in a breath to attempt to pull out and encourage her to walk away now that she’s gotten a taste, maybe she would come back for more after she graduated and they could consider—

She swipes the fat width of her tongue around the underside of his length and gags wide to take him the farthest yet and swallows around his tip and he yanks himself out of her mouth so he doesn’t choke her with a load he feels fighting its way through him. She’s coughing, spitting, and allegedly plotting when she assumes the position he had her in initially again and bends her neck between her shoulders, grabbing his dick and lining it up with her entrance before impaling herself on him, *slowly.* And it happens so fast he careens forward and sees literal stars. Dain swears on all sins and sinners, if he wasn’t deliriously bumbling through this experience he certainly was now.

Sloane cries out, grabbing the duvet on either side of her head once she’s guided him in far enough, “Fuck me,” she demands, “Fuck me!”

He doesn’t even try to argue with her, just slams himself far as he can until her ass won’t let him in any farther.

“Wait,” she gasps, pushing him back with a palm on his hip, “Wait, I didn’t think—,”

“I’m gonna cum, let me fuck you,” he whines, pumping once, he’s suffocating inside of her. She’s collecting parts of his fucking soul in her cunt and divinely condemning him to a good nights rest afterwards so quickly that his vision blotches and he can feel his consciousness sinking away already.

When she gives him a hopeful glance over her shoulder he really loses it, squeezing her hips so hard she reaches back to scratch at his hands; which he then grabs and leans back, using her arms as leverage to pound into her. She’s got no choice but to rebound against him, milking him over again, and again, and *again.* 

Gods, all those times he kept his fucking hands to himself with her next to him, her ass shoved up against him, suffering until the earliest hours of the morning, rendering him a horny reanimated corpse at formation. 

All those times she wore those thin ass tops that her hard nipples poked at. Innocently guiding his hand to her chest in claims that it hurt from sparring—it dawned on him she wanted him *every time*. She wanted his thumbs rolling her caramel nipples between his fingers, pinching, and pulling them. She wanted to lay facing away from him on his arm while he causally pulled her panties and those goddamned *shorts* to the fucking side and shoved his fat, heavy, leaking length right up inside her until it poked at her navel and left her feeling empty the rest of the day while his cum dripped out of her all up until fucking lunch.

*This* feeling of being balls deep in her and it being so tight he winces. Every. Single. Thrust. *Fuck*. And the insidious, wet slapping sounds of his cock echoing fraternization, stroking seniority against her damn walls, play against his ear drums lustfully. 

Just as he reaches around to get her off, she launches upward, curving her spine up and wringing his last bits of consciousness right out of his cock. He shoots thick ropes of cum inside her while buried as deep as she could take him and as he watches himself pulse once, twice and his mind returns to him he *feels* her wet essence flowing down his fucking thighs, damp on his sheets, dripping off his testicles. His body jerks forward violently and he catches himself against her back, panting, drooling even. He’s so exhausted he can’t tell the difference between the pain, the pleasure, or if this aching, heightened sense of overwhelming thrumming throughout his body was the overcharged magic in him or his orgasm.

“Sloane?” He groans, voice hoarse. As he squeezes her waist while he pushes himself back upright, staggering.

She doesn’t answer, but her body deflates ahead of him, still taking his cum. He pulls out, and his length departs her body with an embarrassingly wet *pop.*

“Sloane?” He tries again, sliding his hand between her breasts and pulling her up to his chest again, “Hey?”

Her breathing is steady and her eyes are slowly closing, she’s falling asleep in real time. Sweaty and shaking, Dain lays her down gently, surveilling his work.

She’s absolutely, positively fucking *ruined*. Her ass is red from his assault, a flirting blush is painted perfectly across her back and ears, against her face and tickling down her damp neck. Her breathing steadies slowly and she fights, she really tries to get a look at him as he holds her possessively against his upper body but she’s lost the strength to even hold her eyes open. Her mouth hangs wantonly with satisfaction as her eyes stutter closed and she lets her head fall back against his collarbone, succumbing to exhaustion as he succumbs to post-release clarity.

And then, there’s a loud series of knocks on his door.

*Fuck*.

He jerks upright after pulling his pants up and tying them back, and repositions her closer to the left side of the bed, by the armoire. He rips open the double-doors on the other side, praying the scent of arousal departs swiftly. On the way to the bedroom door he catches sight of himself in the full-length mirror leaned up against the wall before the separating curtain and sees the dark, seeping splashes of Sloane’s excitement against the front of his pants. It’s not just the entirety of the crotch, it’s on the bottom of the thighs, sprayed against his knees.

“Shit.” He grunts.

Fuck, he wishes she’d do that on his *face*.

He shoves the thoughts of how shitty she’s going to think he is tomorrow once she really sleeps and mulls it over. Once she digests that’s she’s slept with the infamous, untrustworthy, profaned wingleader. The son of coward and coward himself.

In the armoire he grabs another set of pants, whatever’s there, and a pair of dark green, casual Tyrrish trousers hangs seductively low against his hips. He can’t be bothered with the way his ashy brown pubes peak out from the top of the waistband and up to his navel. Or that his cock is prominently hanging down his left thigh. As he passes the mirror again he decides they’ll think he was fucking, but who’d even be fucking him, or very deeply sleeping. His eyes are still bloodshot, annd his body is coated in a sheen of sweat, and Sloane hasn’t moved an inch since he covered her with the sheets. He draws back the privacy curtain to conceal her but not the whole bed to satiate a person’s desire to go exploring past it, and pads back to the door, head throbbing. 

“Yes?” He drawls, and, to his favor, the word crackles out of his throat, breaking and drawing harshly on the way up, he clears his throat gruffly.

“Damn Aetos,” Ridoc exclaims, “… you are Aetos right?” He watches as Ridoc gives him an obvious once over and ogles his buldge,

“Don’t be fucking weird.” Dain gripes, fighting back a yawn; he’d be sleeping peacefully with Sloane tucked against him if he weren’t here, “What is…. It?”

It’s not just Ridoc.

It’s Imogen, Matthias, Sawyer, Cat, Maren, Lynx, and Baylor. It’s almost the whole damn squad.

“Nice… room.” Sawyer manages, following Ridoc’s line of sight and then looking away with wide eyes back to Dain’s midsection, then his face.

“You seen Sloane?” Lynx asks, and he barely avoids flinching,

“Can we come in? I don’t think we should just be roaming this floor.” Maren says, glancing down the hall past Cat.

[xx]

He wakes Sloane after letting her sleep in the time it takes him to fill the claw-footed tub in his bathroom. It’s his first time in the attached wash-chamber and he’s sincerely awed. The ceiling bares gilded crown moldings over onyx stones, the walls polished mosaic, Tyrrish tiling. There’s a window behind the tub that’s square in shape but with a wide, slowly arching top. He can see the revived town beneath, lit up the darkness of the coming night. He finds a plethora of soaps, towels, and other luxuries in the linen closet of the wash room, he decides he’ll just let Sloane pick what she wants by the time the tiled room is warm and steaming from running water.

“Sloane.” He repeats her name until she stirs awake, then picks her up, “Bath.”

She sighs and maneuvers herself so that he can handle her more easily. When they reach the bathroom he sets her down on her feet, the grandeur of the bathing chamber wakes her momentarily and he watches as she steps into the tub and surveys the space.

“There’s extra of everything in here, toothbrushes too.” He tells her as he approaches the closet, “Have a scent preference?”

“What’s there to pick from?”

He reads her the available choices and she picks a citrus type, for shampoo and soap.

“You like citrus smells.” He says to himself,

“And florals.” She adds, taking the product from him, “And whatever you normally wear.”

”It’s a musk from a shop back in Navarre.” He frowns, “I only have that small container now.”

Sloane lifts her chin, “Tell me what the shops called and I’ll bring you more.”

“You don’t even know what the smell is.” He teases,

“Don’t need to,” she unbraids her hair before speaking again, “I can recognize your smell anywhere.” Her face washes scarlet and she ducks her head into the tub after the rest of her body.

When she resubmerges he loses the words. Her hair is pin straight, molded perfectly to her visible silhouette while soaked, but immediately adopting huge, crashing waves as the water tumbles away from the strands.

“That so?” He chides, clicking his tongue.

“Of course.” She begins slathering her body with a wash rag and the soap, suds form all over her body, “You always smell good.”

He doesn’t say anything, just watches the rag as it dips and dives over every curve of her hips and thighs, the round peak of her ass. Her breasts, arms then her shoulders.

“Don’t forget to wash me out too.” He pokes, playfully.

She freezes and turns back to him face even more impossibly flushed, “I didn’t imagine you’d end up being such a degenerate.”

His eyebrows raise, “Me?”

She nods.

“*Please Dain.*” He repeats her words from earlier as saucily as he can. Its the best thing he's ever heard. The most ethereal tone his name has ever been said in. The most unrooting phrase he's experienced in all of his life.

“Get out.” She venomously demands, “Unless you’re getting in.”

A grin cracks across his face, “In? Or out, Sloane? How do you want me.”

She drags the soapy rag across her face and gives her scathing reply with an exasperated groan, “In.”

He obliges her.

It’s dark out when they emerge from the bathing chamber. He’s finally washed properly, shaved and manicured at her request. Sloane leads him to the bed with her hand wrapped over his,

“Oh, the sheets...” She remarks, and he looks over his shoulder from the armoire to the bed. It’s freshly made with pitch black sheets instead of the white ones, his duvet is now a deep foliaged green. Sloane's blessing has been whisked away to be laundered. Dain frowns.

“Rang the bell before we went to wash up.”

Sloane guffaws, “Hospitality services?”

“Perks of being injured, you get a ‘help me’ bell.” He hands her a soft white shirt, “Here.”

She slips it on and then into his bed, watching him dress into a sleeping set and pull the curtain closed as well as the patio doors.

“So…” she starts, her voice is muddled with coming sleep, “Are you gonna pretend this didn’t happen?”

“No.” He frowns, working his way into the bed next to her, “Why would I do that?”

She laughs into his chest, “Because your first love is the Codex.”

“I can make exceptions. But….” He snorts,

“But what? I’m not worth it? Rank?” She prods, shuffling against him,

He looks down at her, “You’re worth more than I can put into words… You saved Navarre. And Mira. And you’ll do so much more than that, we’re young you know.” He trails kisses across her hairline and forehead, “You’re a Mairi and—”

“*Mairi’s don’t yield.*” She finishes for him.

“Exactly. I just have to get my… priorities in order.”

For the first time in months he gets sleep that leaves him feeling truly refreshed in the morning. Pain ebbs over his body absently and Sloane’s wavy blonde tresses spill all around him, he’s intoxicated by the sight and smell of her. She’s clinging to him as usual, her brow is furrowed a bit, and her eyes are definitely swollen.

“*You’ve finally slept properly.”*

Dain chuckles.

“*Good morning, Cath.”*

“*The sun is risen before you.*”

Cath submerges the bond with swells of contentedness.

Dain prays hard to his Gods, prays for their futures to feel like this. Prays for Navarre and Poromiel, Tyrrendore and the Isles. For Violet and Xaden. He dresses in his summer flight leathers and requests the floor aide to retrieve Sloane’s clothes from her room after freshening up. Then, he kisses her deep, rouses her and she’s stirring underneath him, “See you around.” He whispers into her hair.

He grabs the halberd and sets off to the courtyard for Cath.
