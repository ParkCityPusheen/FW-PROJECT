His sleep is dreamless.

*But* it's nothing foreboding; just empty, sensory deprived, and voided space that he awakes from with a slight stir.

Dain's body tenses in habit, toes spreading, back expanding, his mouth stretches wide as it can and a yawn rips from the back of his throat right into Sloane's navel. He rolls his forehead against the soft unmarked skin of hers, pressing his nose into her belly button and blinking sleep from his eyes.

A glance at the window between his desk and the bed tells him it's not time to start getting ready yet—the fact that he's up means it'll be soon though.

He remains thoughtless against her, breathing her in—still somehow yuzu scented, still kissed by that edge of tonka bean. The warmth of it lingers in his mouth: smooth, pleasantly sugary, like caramel left to melt.

Maybe it’s just her. That’s how she smells.

Effervescent lemon-orange brightness softened by something richer—those simmering aldehydes that remind him of vanilla, but not quite. Like cream with a spine. And florals—elusive, like something still pressed between pages he never opened.

Typically those perfumes are chased away after the things they'd done with each other—so *how?* 

A shower oil maybe? Not just soap?

Dain's been around royalty, nobility—he knows there are humans who live lives entirely uncentered from war and death. People with six-step hygiene routines and personal aides for every single part.

So _how_, after he’s sweated over her, licked and sucked and dragged his mouth across every inch of her, does she still smell so fucking mouthwatering?

His eyes narrow.

He hadn’t put his mouth over her entirely.

The thought flickers—terrorizes him—he hadn’t _tasted_ her.

Dain’s gaze drags lower, assessing Amari’s greatest achievement with deep and solemn consideration. She’d come to him. Come _on_ him. She wouldn’t mind if he indulged—maybe more than just a little, right?

He unwinds from her hold with deliberate care, sliding down her body slowly—_painfully_ slowly. By the time his nose brushes near her clit, he’s fully hard and aching in suspense.

Her hands twitch at the loss of his weight, trailing downward until they find his hair. That seems to settle her and she fades fully into subconsciousness again.

He glides a hand up the slope of her thigh and stills when she shifts, bending her leg in her sleep. The motion grants him just enough room to wedge his shoulder beneath it, lifting her open above his face. 

He looks at her—plump, flushed—and inhales *deeply*.

The bright, floral tang of her skin is absent here. What lingers now is deeper. Darker. Intimate. Equally seductive as anywhere else on her body—but so much more raw.

Dain leans forward and licks her from entrance to slit, his tongue flat and greedy, intended to taste as he laves up the length of her. He does it twice, and that second time he's sure to double back and between each of her labia, then prods at her clit with the tip of his tongue.

She stirs above him and his eyes snap upwards to her scrunched face.

He grabs handfuls of her ass and pulls her against his mouth, angling her so he can press his tongue inside—most people fancy the smell of their food before they eat it.

*While,* they eat it—he supposes.

Sloane's eyes rip open, sapphire irises instantly alive as the sensations waking her from sleep register,

"You—"

A moan tears through her chest and rips free of her throat.

"You need help.” Her fingers twist hard in his hair, mouth open in shock, the slapping shut in pleasure,

“I _am_ helping,” he manages against her soaked flesh, but the words are muffled because he's talking with his mouth full.

Her eyes flare and her hips twitch, unsure whether to pull away or grind against his face—and Dain hopes to the Gods it’s the latter,

“Ride my face,” he murmurs, slipping his tongue free to replace it with a finger.

Her back arches, blonde hair fluttering as she twists away from him on instinct.

“I can’t—”

He frowns.

Then grabs her thighs and _hauls_ her over his face like she weighs nothing.

“_Ride it,_” he demands. “Lean back—and ride my fucking face, Sloane.”

"I already want to come Dain, how long have you—"

He sinks another finger into her and circles them against her at the back.

"Then come in my mouth."

He smacks her ass, *hard.*

Sloane yips and jerks forward, impaling herself on the rebound and dragging her cunt against his tongue at the same time,

Dain almost moans, "Yes," he hisses, "Show me how desperate you get—_ride._"

She leans back against him and finally commits, rolling her hips on his face and tilting them up; she rips off his shirt when it gets in the way a few times and he sears the image straight through his fucking brain.

Sloane's completely fucking naked, hips jutting out over his face, her pussy glistening, swollen, and soaked with his mouth against it, with his fingers disappearing in and out of her while she moans his fucking name so loudly he's *certain* its being heard halfway down the hallway.

There's no sound-shield cast on his room—he never needed it and now he doesn't want it,

He wants these fucking hyenas to hear his name being chanted by Amari's chosen herself while he unspools her singlehandedly, unwinding her into fluttering lashes and trembling calves.

"You're hard," she gasps pointlessly,

"What?" his brows knit, "I don't care."

"Dain, *please,*" she wails, lunging forwards and grabbing the headboard for leverage. She rams herself against his mouth, skin-to-skin, a true *grind,* desperate to come. Dain works a hand between them, replacing his fingers inside of her and pressing his thumb against her clit,

"Tell me," he gasps, and she teeters a bit.

He grabs her thigh as she squats over him; he can feel her pulling away and his grip becomes a vice, "I *might*, I'm so sorry—"

She escapes him—impressively, he must admit—and flings herself over the edge of the bed, her body seizing like a wire pulled taut.

"Sloane?"

He watches her curl into herself, shaking so hard it borders on concerning.

A faint slick glistens below her and against her legs.

Dain’s brows lift, the rest of him still caught in the gravity of it.

"—I think I had to pee," she shivers, still crouched and teetering forward. "I just—"

Sloane stops talking, abruptly, when she catches the way his expression crumples in real time.

“You should’ve just done that on my face.” he chides, clicking his tongue—glaring at her.

Her head drops forward in disbelief, “How the fuck are you this *feral* first thing in the morning?"

Dain opens his mouth to answer, but he has nothing—he’d just wanted a taste, a sweet treat to start the day.

He shrugs.

“You’re unwell. *Actually* unwell.” she gapes.

---

"Mairi's absent," Maiselle tells Dain while blowing a perfect ringlet away from her face; her eyes scans the dais ahead of them, she raises her brow at him—he's down here instead of with leadership again, and his father isn't there which she's clearly observed.

"Authorized." Dain sighs.

Sloane had wrapped herself up in a bed sheet and made him carry her over his shoulder to her room, kissed him and told him she would probably be missing formation but not class.

*"With your permission, of course."* she had added, with a wink, and then closed the door in his face.

Maiselle lingers. “Was that consensual?” she blurts at last, hazel irises sharp and slicing through the memory,

His fingers slide up to his throat, "Is it that bad?"

Maiselle lifts a brow. “Is it?”

Her tone is light, but there's a line in her cheek that betrays restraint. Dain exhales again, longer this time. Doesn’t answer.

They don’t speak again—not until formation breaks and cadets scatter like ants displaced by a boot heel, trailing off in every direction across the courtyard.

Maiselle stays beside him, even after the crowd thins.

"I'm not sure why you picked me to be your EO, but I appreciate the opportunities it's opened for me in you doing so."

Dain turns to glance at her as a gust of wind sweeps through the courtyard. “I appreciate you not being weird about me,” he replies, the words soft but sincere. “And I hope I never see your name on a death roll.”

"Yours as well." she tips her head up to the dark morning skies, nodding, "Here's to War Games?"

She peels away a moment later, disappearing into the folds of the courtyard and toward her preferred crowd.

He tracks her only long enough to notice Violet in the distance—approaching now, slow and purposeful, one hand lifted in a subtle wave.

"We should talk," she begins, gesturing to the rotunda, "Your room or mine?"

Dain's head tilts.

"Trouble?"

A face-splitting grin tears across her otherwise unreadable expression.

"I stopped by last night—and just as I was about to knock I realized you were *busy.*"

His eyes slam shut.

"You and who else?"

"Me—and everyone *you told* you’d see later."

He brushes past her, striding towards the dormitory again.

*Fuck.*

---

Violet gets straight to the point.

She releases Dain’s hand only once they’ve passed the wards and heads straight for his desk. She takes a seat like she owns it—like they don’t have a year of unspoken things between them. He sinks into his chair across from her at the table, hands shoved deep into the pockets of his flight jacket.

It’s getting colder outside.

Much like his past, the cold weather always lingered just beyond comfort—hovering at the edge of every warm experience. It fogged his breath in the earliest hours of morning, coaxed goosebumps across his skin when he wore summer leathers at night, and, when he least expected it, settled into his _bones_ with aching finality.

"Do you think Dòrainn would be willing to speak with us about the missing eggs—the dead elders too?"

She starts with what she knows, laying out the most pertinent thread she has: Dòrainn is an elder. And after Draithus, there were dead and missing riders—eggs gone, elders gone. All of it.

Dain hedges, watching the way Violet’s gaze lingers—not just on him, but _through_ him, sharp and searching.

"No," he says finally. "I could ask, but I'm sure he's about as willing as Tairn is to mention anything. That is, assuming he even knows."

She doesn’t blink. If anything, she leans in, expression unreadable but deliberate.

"Well, wouldn’t he?" Violet presses, voice just a shade too casual. "_He's_ _an_ _elder._"

He shakes his head, slow. "That's exactly my point."

Cath’s words beat against the back of his thoughts: _There are some elders; he is one._

Violet exhales, folding inward slightly as she leans forward and rests her forehead against the table. Her eyes—a shifting calico mix of hazel, amber, and green—stay on him, even through the curtain of her hair. Constantly changing, constantly searching.

Dain watches her a moment longer, then speaks—measured, but not soft.

"Just to be clear. We know the Empyrean exists. But we have no real understanding of its structure—or who actually holds seats within it."

He lets the silence stretch. Lets her sit in the unknown with him.

Then he continues.

"We know Codagh is the eldest bonded dragon—and ranked on par with Melgren in war efforts. As a general among dragons, you'd *assume* he holds a seat in the Empyrean."

Violet lifts her head. Dain can see her processing.

"Then there's Tairn," he continues. "There are only two Black dragons in Navarre—himself and Codagh. As the strongest and the eldest, we’d assume by default that Codagh is the den head."

"Based on conversations I’ve had with Tairn, he is," she confirms.

"So it tracks. Then we consider Aretia, where Tairn is the only Black dragon. Again, we _assume_ he's the den head and holds a seat within the Aretian Empyrean. And Andarna is the only Irid—which by default makes her the eldest and head of her den. Unless there's some hidden structure even she’s not aware of."

"Yes, *assumed,*" Violet echoes, pulling her feet into the chair and sitting cross-legged. "When the riot split, so did the dens. But what’s your point?"

"My point," Dain says, eyes steady, "is that it’s all assumption. Not a single dragon has _confirmed_ Codagh holds a seat, or anything else we just deducted. And we don’t know what qualifies a dragon to sit on the Empyrean—age, power, den leadership?"

They lock eyes.

"Or what separates an elder from _one of the_ elders, if being an elder implies something outside of being an older dragon," he adds.

"I always figured the Empyrean was made up of the heads of each breed’s dens," she murmurs, toying with the end of her braid. "But is that the strongest? The eldest?"

"...I don’t know."

"Right."

Dain reaches for one of the pens on his desk—the one filled with red ink. He twirls it around his finger, the way Sloane spins her glaive.

"It’s easier to assume things with the Black dragons, and Andarna—there’s only two. But with the Greens or Reds? Who knows. I’d guess the ones who lit the wardstone in Tyrrendor were den heads within the Aretian riot."

Violet stands, then sinks back down, knees stretching. “Because we needed the breath of the strongest six—seven.”

She pauses. "How many seats are even in the Empyrean? Are they all bonded? Is bonding even required?"

Dain lifts a hand, face tilting into a _your guess is as good as mine_ scrunch.

He'd given all of this plenty of consideration and stood by the idea that new approaches and mindsets needed to be wired into those bonded. There was far too much assumptive decision making on behalf of riders.

"But what if elders are the heads of dens? And if they are why would Cath have said to me: *'There are some elders; Dòrainn is one,'* when Dòrainn is visual mix of Tairn and Codagh—there's no way a dragon who looks like that was never *not* the head of their den."

"I mean it does make sense that elders might just be older dragons and nothing more."

Dain flicks the pen around his thumb, "Which means he wouldn't know anything and considering we don't even know how to *unmistakenly determine* what dragon is a den-head, elder, or both. Or if being elders means anything outside of being old."

"What's the actual reason you just made me go through that?" She finally inquires with a bright look of curiosity, tapping the table with her index finger.

"Because I *do* think Cath is the head of his den."

She tilts her head and scratches between the plaits of her corner braid.

He's about ready to reveal some of these secrets he's been withholding to make his point but he needs something—something tangible from her.

Something shared with mutual restraint between the two of them for him to feel comfortable potentially risking his swordtail's life—*their* lives really, but primarily Cath's because why would he give a singular *fuck* about existing in a world without his dragon.

"And that's important because?"

"Because he’s been spoon-feeding me information—about myself—only after, I assume, discussing the risks of doing so."

He watches as his words hum over her skin like morning dew in between blades of grass, he waits with his teeth clenched for her to ask—

"—information about *you?*"

He closes his eyes while letting his head bob into a series of nods.

"Why would the *Empyrean* be withholding information about a *human.*"

Her gaze is diamond fiber that peels each layer of his skin away in perfect successions as she blinks, waiting for him to answer.

He stands in the wasteland of his bond with Cath, senses him there and *prods* his dragon for an opinion, or a feeling, or a show of restraint before daring to answer.

Cath only remains an ever-vigilant presence in his mind—just existing to observe,

*"Learn to trust."* he tells Dain once more, in the same tone he did last night.

"I need to feel like... I have a secret of yours in order to give up all of mine." He mutters, "If it were just me, I could tell you."

He stops spinning the pen, and exchanges it for the one with black ink.

"If I tell you, I risk Cath. If *you* or anyone else endangers my dragon—I'll kill you. I'll kill you swift and thoughtlessly."

Violet's eyes *shine.*

"It's mutual." She declares, then, "Then, in light of the risks we take, I would like to formally redeem our friendship; I trust you, and more importnantly: I miss you."

His breath hitches.

*More importantly I miss you.*

Love.

He'd always love Violet Sorrengail. All the Sorrengails.

"Okay, Vi." He chuckles, letting a smile plaster across his face, "Bestfriends. Now—allow me to gut myself internally?"

"Go right ahead." She's grinning at him, but he wonders how long the expression will survive when he starts to speak,

"I'll be brief. Started getting sick after I stopped training my signet regularly—*bad* too, throwing up blood, coughing so bad I'd nearly pissed myself, passing out during flight maneuvers. Around the same time I started realizing I was *missing* memories nearly as often as I was *unintentionally reading* them."

He stops, lets her make a comment if she wants which she does,

"You told us—that you can read memories without touching now. *Fully* inntinnsic." She remarks,

"Believe it or not, the few times I've trained with Catriona have been so helpful that I've gotten to a place I feel completely comfortable in."

He's proud of that, and lets it show in a soft smile.

Cath lets him *feel* it from himself by washing Dain with bubbling pride.

"That was fast." She blinks, "I thought you were getting sick because it was evolving into a stronger version of itself."

Dain's lips thin into an undecided line.

"Yes and no." He adds, setting the pen down, "It requires more magic to utilize than it used to because of its new capabilities—but thanks to Cath I know it's solely my magic that makes me sick."

Violet inhales deeply; so does Dain.

"Because..."

"We channel so much magic that it overcharges me. And Cath has to temper my magic, while storing it for his own uses. The excess that he can't handle affects negatively in the ways I described previously."

Her brows knit and she holds out her palm in inquisition, "Why doesn't he stop channeling so much magic all the time then?"

He clears his throat.

"Because he's not the one channeling it."

Her throat works.

"Before you say anything..." he scratches at his cuticles and leans forward in the chair, bracing himself against the desk,

"There's two plausible reasons and one glaringly obvious absolute false."

He lifts up his index finger, and raises his shields as strongly as he can, "One: I'm a naturally occuring anomaly—*the anomaly* is what Dòrainn and Cath have been calling it, and I guess the Empyrean too—and this is just how I work—"

He breathes deep and exhales *slow,* "—since Cath and I bonded way before Threshing was ever a thought in my mind."

Violet audibly gasps and shoots to her feet.

"How—"

He continues, "Two: one of my parents was venin, because Cath also said I was *born* channeling."

Violet's jaw was surely descending past the earth's core with the way her mouth was *still hanging open.*

"And the absolute false: that I’m some kind of… half-dragon hybrid. Like, constitutionally"

He immediately rubs his face into his hands when he's down and gestures for her to let loose,

"None of those are necessarily bad things." She mutters, eyes optimistic and phasing blue as she stares at the floor.

"You're thinking I might be able to help Xaden if I'm venin?" He grunts,

She nods and curls her fists at her sides.

He chuckles, "Me *too*."

When she looks up, teary-eyed and ready to unleash a flurry of questions on him, he sees her the happiest she's looked since before she lost her lover in Draithus. His shoulders sag, maybe at the weight of his mind easing with the burden of his existence being placed equally on another person, or possibly at her accepting all of his confessions with grace and optimism.

"My point though," he finally adds, "Is that we can't trust the Empyrean, and we can't trust Navarre—Violet you have to find the time to organize an assembly of people who are highly qualified and trustworthy. All we have are our dragons and it seems like they don't even trust each other."

"Well, that'll be done soon." She says dismissively, "No worries."

Dain cocks a brow.

"I'm requesting to be formally excused from completing my third year at Basgiath."

His mouth is the one that springs open this time,

"I have a fucking *Province* to run." She finishes, "And I'll be damned to destroy what my husband's left in my care."

While he hadn't been expecting her to say that, the reason she provided is enough—of course the, *having* a Province (not the husband part)—Violet being at Basgiath was pointless. She was already one of the most dangerous wielders and bonded to one of the strongest known dragons, plus another.

"I also have reason to believe leadership is venin aligned, to include their dragons." He stands up to look out of his window; he's got a nice view, one that centers the bell tower,

"Or," he turns back to Violet after catching a glimpse of Cath, and his voice bears the weight of his fear, "that some dragons are venin aligned and willing to betray their riders."

Violet joins him, standing at his side to observe the sight from his window, and blinking at the sight of Red winding around it.

Cath is nudging at Dain's shields—warning him that his private time is dwindling.

"I think our priority right now should be understanding the boundaries we're working in. Not what we're up against. I don't think mindlessly killing venin helps when they come back from it."

She rubs his arm, tentatively, as he drops his shields; then pats his head, ruffles the hair there like she's his parent,

"What are you thinking?"

"I think Xaden and you had a plan, and looking for him actively obstructs it. Otherwise why else would you protect yourself the way you did—with Imogen?"

She looks torn but she nods.

"And you're suggesting I do what?"

"Lay low. After I graduate I'll be running into venin left and right. I plan to find a way to detect them before they can cause harm, and also I think there's an imbalance of magic currently. On the continent. That's why they're getting stronger."

"There's no way to rebalance magic, the barrens have none."

Dain glances down at her, "I think balance can also means within oneself, rather than as a whole. And I think there's a lot of people who can't wield magic who feel forsaken, and they're turning to join them because that's easier and more instantaneously promising *change* than possibly dying crossing the parapet."

He blinks at her, "I guess I'm saying we need to get Aretia rebuilt and quickly, and help Pomromiel recover as well. To give people something to believe in. A reason not to lose hope."

Then, his head drops, "Denying people is an awful experience at the receiving end. Andarna and the Irids, myself and my father—*and* the Empyrean, I mean why even keep me alive? And the Irids aren't interested in even helping the dragons here. We're on our own with the fliers in this. We have to try anything that will stop their numbers from growing."

"Everything." Violet corrects. "That sounds like something similar to what Aaric told me a few weeks ago..."

She shifts her weight and pulls his arm to force him to face her,

"I have a second signet."

Dain chews the inside of his cheek, "Naturally." He offers.

"It's... dreamwalking."

"Oh." He tilts his head so far that Violet does the same, "Fellow inntinnsic."

She laughs and pulls him into a timid hug, "Fellow inntinnsic."

"How does that even work?"

She throws her hands up, "I couldn't tell you, I'm still figuring out myself."

"Yeah." Dain concedes, quietly, "We're figuring *all* of this out ourselves, Vi."

She doesn’t respond right away—just nods, her eyes flicking toward the window where the Red's still coil around the bell tower.

Cath’s presence nudges against Dain’s shields again, firmer this time. He sighs and rises, stretching the moment like it might last longer if he moved slowly enough.

"I’ll see you at muster?"

"Unless I see you first," she murmurs, and that old smirk—the one from before everything—makes the briefest return.

Dain smiles.

Then— there's a knock at the door.

He frowns, glances at Violet, then crosses the room to answer it.

And, he pulls it open—his father is standing on the other side.

"Ah," he grates, eyes narrowing in disgust as they bounce from his son to Violet, "I see you have... *company.*"

Violet straightens, smile sharp. "Just your average duchess discussing the logistics of juggling provincial management _and_ cadet life with her wingleader—"

"—You should both be mustering for War Games," he cuts in coldly, not even looking at her, his gaze locked on Dain like a blade drawn point-first. "Not skipping class."

The air pulls tight. Violet’s chin lifts.

"Of course," she says, voice clipped but controlled. She throws Dain a look—worried and lingering—and then brushes past his father like he isn’t even there. She pauses just long enough in the doorway to murmur over her shoulder,

"Don't be too long."

He doesn’t answer, just watches her go while her figure disappears down the corridor, swallowed by stone and morning hush. For a moment, he stays with the echo of her voice, her footsteps, the fading warmth of the room.

Then he turns back and the world *tips.*

Light bursts across his vision, not bright so much as blinding—shimmering white at the edges, then graying, then dark. His legs buckle beneath him like they no longer belong to him, and he goes down, body folding without grace. A slow fall. Sudden, but inevitable.

His shoulder hits first. Then his hip. Then the side of his head strikes the stone with a dull, wet thud.

Something warm trails down his temple.

Blood, maybe?

His heart pulses sluggishly, echoing inside his skull, and the room spins on an axis he can’t trace. He blinks, just once, and his father stands there, not crouching, not reaching—just watching as though irritated by the delay.

Dain’s breath catches. His hands twitch at his sides.

His father doesn’t move, doesn’t even flinch as Dain’s eyes start to close, as the last threads of consciousness slip loose—

"Let’s see how long it takes your dragon to find you," he murmurs at last—low, and almost *bored*.

—Dain fades out to the faint, frantic scraping of Cath at the edges of his mind.
