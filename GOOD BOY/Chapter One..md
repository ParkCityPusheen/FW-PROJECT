It’s important to remember that things can always get worse. Life almost never yields at rock bottom, in fact, it offers guided tours of it's basement; renovated with shattered glass, splintered wood, and its contractor still grunting somewhere in your living room.

Years of unsolicited tactical lessons surface in the corners of Sloane’s mind as she steps further into her home. Her father’s voice tells her to pie her corners, to breathe steady, to listen between steps. Her eyes skim the scatter of broken glass as she lifts her feet, inhaling slow through her nose, and deep out of her mouth. A single grunt draws her attention, then another answers it. Not one intruder. *Two.*

There's a moment where reality dawns, that she shouldn't be walking into her townhouse mid robbery, that she should really just call the local authorities and let justice be served properly; but the thing was, here in Navarre, it never happened.

She could call the guard, but unless they caught the criminal red handed Sloane knew nothing would come of this.

A particular howl of wood, and then it's snapping makes her stomach lurch; she recognizes that sound just before the furniture gives way and no, she doesn't need to see it break to know it's her solid wood, one-of-one, mid-century, coffee table gifted to her by Imogen.

Her eyes twitch.

It had been damaged irrepealably by her dog, Law, once before and since showcased a bent frame with a rigid glass-top that no longer sat flush at its surface. Law had been injured in the mishap; he'd always been eerily intelligent, and for all his size he moved with intention to avoid it at all costs, and no matter the bribe, you couldn't tempt him to cross that space again.

Wait—*where fuck was her dog?*

Anxiety seeps between her clammy skin and heated blood, it reaches its curved talons into her heart and she falters, setting her sneakered foot down to flat and too fast. A larger chunk breaks into bits underneath the weight of her leg and there's a pause just ahead before the shadow of a man she's never seen before lifts and his shadow is cast across her kitchen cabinets.

He's tall, lanky, wearing... dog ears?

Was she being robbed by *furries?*

Sloane swears she can count the seconds before his silhouette pivots and the solid lines of his shadow shrink. He's walking *towards* her. She pulls her phone away from her pocket, holding the lock and volume buttons until the emergency call shortcut is prompted and—*calling emergency services in 10... 9... 8...*

She almost laughs as her feet begin to windmill backwards at the shrill scream that echoes through the walls of her townhouse,

"Die! You fucking *freak!*" 

The scream ricochets through the hallways, but no one lunges for her. Instead two shadows crash together against the light, fists and snarls, furniture groaning under their weight. She creeps nearer in spite of herself, breath shallow and her mouth hanging open. Then the sound shifts, fabric stretching, leather pulling against skin as it sticks to them. They're fighting on her damn couch now. Sloane's gaze locks on the shape digging into the lanky man’s throat. The curve of a buckle. The shine of a tag. It's seems familiar. Too familiar.

Her brain supplies the recognition before she wants it to: that is _Law’s_ collar.

There's a split second taken to consolidate the last hour of her life before she steps into view of both men.

She'd spent the entire day arguing with the project sponsor and design manager about safety in structural integrity, while they talked in circles about cutting costs in practicality for the sake of aesthetic.

She'd gotten a cab home, because ten blocks from home the sky opened up and begin to piss on everyone in this godforsaken city.

Her cab stank so badly of fish and gyros that she became lightheaded and made the mistake of dropping her forehead on the window that was slick with humidity (she hoped); and the lack of knowledge at what had sweated against the cab window with this fucking *stench* made her then exit the cab, after paying of course, and walk the remaining five blocks home.

But after making it to the end of her entryway hall, Sloane realized the townhouse had been ransacked and turned sideways, and her dog was nowhere to be seen.

For the last five years *Marshall Law,* Law, for short, met her approximately five feet from her front door, haunches curved regally as he sat, and his long tail curved over his huge paws. 

And now there was some psychopath with fuzzy ears, an identical tail, hair, fur color and all, being asphyxiated with his collar on her couch.

Upon further inspection, both males are easily twice the size of her and covered in glass and blood, *and* one of them, not the one with the same tail, ears, and fur—hair—color as Law, is one she knows. One she knows, and not because they met at work.

It's her stalker.

The one who goaded her for a whole year, five years ago. The one who had her so paranoid she lived with her parents, and eventually her older brother whom worried for her the most.

Then, came Law. Marshall Law.

A pedigreed Beauceron shipped to her from Calldyr, fully grown and completely trained as a guard dog from a self-proclaimed breeder who she could never find again once he'd arrived
