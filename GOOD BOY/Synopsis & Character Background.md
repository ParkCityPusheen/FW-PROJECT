### **Premise**

Sloane has spent the past six years living with Law, her quiet, aloof Estrela Mountain Dog, a companion she adopted after a stalker scare left her feeling unsafe in her own home. She never imagined the danger wasn’t gone — or that the animal she trusted most was hiding a secret even stranger.

One night, she comes home from work to find Law covered in blood, locked in a brutal fight with the stalker who has broken into her apartment from the balcony. In the chaos, the impossible happens: Law transforms into a man — tall, lean, with the same floppy ears and swaying tail she’s known for years.

Shaken, Sloane rushes him to the vet (because what else do you do when your dog has a knife wound and also might be a man?). But afterward, he refuses to take human form again. Weeks pass with no answers, no explanations — just her same quiet, watchful dog who now carries a mystery she can’t forget.

### **Sloane**

- **Background:**
    
    - Age: Late 20s to early 30s.
        
    - Accomplished architect with a master’s degree.
        
    - No husband or children; extremely close with her loving family and protective older brother.
        
    - Best friends:
        
        - _Imogen_ — older, grounded, a voice of reason.
            
        - _Avalynn_ — college classmate turned ultra-successful social media influencer, impulsive, fun, and fiercely loyal.
            
- **Personality:**
    
    - Outgoing, sarcastic, comfortable taking up space in a conversation.
        
    - Fiercely independent, but emotionally tied to the few people (and animals) she trusts.
        
    - Boundary-blind — not intentionally cruel, but tends to push people closer without realizing they might need distance.
        
    - Keeps the transformation a secret because she’s confused and a little scared, but mostly because she doesn’t know how to explain it without sounding unhinged.
        
- **Conflict:**
    
    - Hurt by Law’s refusal to acknowledge what happened.
        
    - Frustrated by his constant avoidance and silence.
        
    - Unwilling to admit how much she misses the easy companionship they had before that night.

### **Dain / “Law”**

- **Background:**
    
    - Real name: Dain Aetos.
        
    - Born in the early 1900s; physically appears in his late 20s.
        
    - Spent decades exclusively in dog form, avoiding human transformation entirely.
        
    - Collar was fitted so tightly that his vocal cords have mild, permanent damage, making speech rough and painful — but he’s also simply out of practice and in no rush to relearn.
        
    - Literate and well-educated for his time; still reads and writes with ease.
        
- **Personality:**
    
    - In both forms: quiet, observant, unapproachable to strangers, deeply protective.
        
    - In human form: intensely shy, old-fashioned in mannerisms and boundaries.
        
    - Standoffish not out of malice, but out of discomfort — especially in modern social settings.
        
    - Feels deeply for Sloane but doesn’t know how to express it without breaking the fragile rhythm they’ve kept for years.
        
- **Conflict:**
    
    - Fears overwhelming Sloane with the truth of his past.
        
    - Mistakes her unease for fear _of him_, which makes him withdraw further.
        
    - Struggles to reconcile his old-world instincts with the closeness she’s used to.
        

- During the fight in Sloane’s apartment, the stalker looped the collar tight around Dain’s neck, trying to choke him into submission.
    
- The pressure damaged his vocal cords, leaving his voice rough and strained.
    
- He _could_ speak now if he pushed himself, but it’s painful, and after decades of silence in human form, he has little drive to force it.
    
- For Sloane, the silence feels like willful avoidance. For Dain, it’s both physical limitation and emotional caution.

### **The Central Dynamic**

- They already share years of implicit trust from living together, but the reveal disrupts their balance.
    
- **Sloane** keeps poking at the silence, desperate for some acknowledgment, while **Dain** clings to his avoidance, thinking it’s what she wants.
    
- Their tension builds in small, domestic moments — her brushing past him in the kitchen, him shadowing her movements when she leaves the apartment, neither addressing the truth directly.
    

The turning point comes after a night out with Avalynn to celebrate the near eradication of her stalker. Sloane comes home drunk and raw, the weeks of avoidance crashing into her in one frustrated outburst: _“If you hate being here so much, go.”_

Instead of leaving, Dain shifts into his human form for the first time since that night — and though he still won’t explain, the deliberate way he meets her eyes makes it clear: whatever’s keeping him silent, it isn’t hatred.
