It takes twenty minute to walk home and only two seconds to decide not to and even less to hail the cab that smells like hot Luceran seafood and stale bread. Sloane hands her driver a flat bill and yawns out her address only after pulling on her headphones and letting her head fall against the sedan's cold window.

This week was truly dancing across her last nerve.

She'd worked plenty of small projects during college and after, a few large since graduation, but this was by far her largest and most ambitious one.


You can set it up by stacking **three layers** before you even get to the missing-Dain beat:

1. **External grit** – Give the reader Sloane’s mood before she even hits the door.
    
    - The day’s tone: the noise of the city, the feel of her clothes after hours in them, the way the outlet mall project has been chipping away at her patience.
        
    - Specific irritants: contractor squabbles, endless change orders, the client’s fickleness — not as a rant, but threaded into her thoughts while she’s making her way home.
        
    - Let her physical state mirror her mood (heels biting into her, shoulders stiff from carrying a laptop bag, hair sticking from humidity).
        
2. **Transitional quiet** – Use the shift from public space to private space as a sensory pivot.
    
    - She leaves the chaos outside: door locks clicking, street sounds muffled, scent of home replacing sawdust or exhaust.
        
    - This is also a good place to drop a subtle emotional undercurrent — home is supposed to be her relief, her buffer from the day.
        
3. **The absence** – Tilt the atmosphere.
    
    - Normally, Dain’s presence is noticeable: a sound, a scent, some low-level awareness she’s used to.
        
    - Let her register the silence first, then actively notice what’s missing. Maybe the usual boots by the door aren’t there, the kettle hasn’t been set, the faint vibration of his voice in another room isn’t present.
        
    - Her mind can flick briefly between possible reasons — mundane or otherwise — which lets you seed her reaction without overexplaining.
        

If you layer it that way, the “Dain’s not here” moment lands as a **change in her sanctuary’s usual rhythm**, not just an empty room.

If you want, I can sketch out **a beat map** for how those three layers might flow in your actual prose so you have a spine to work from.
